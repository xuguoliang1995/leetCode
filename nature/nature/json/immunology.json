At the time of analysis, previous genome-wide association studies7,8,9,10,11,12 (GWAS) reported 16 genomic loci associated to neuroticism10,11,12. Here we conducted a large GWAS meta-analysis (n = 449,484) of neuroticism and identified 136 independent genome-wide significant loci (124 new at the time of analysis), which implicate 599 genes. Functional follow-up analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell types, including dopaminergic neuroblasts (P = 3.49 × 10−8), medium spiny neurons (P = 4.23 × 10−8), and serotonergic neurons (P = 1.37 × 10−7). Gene set analyses implicated three specific pathways: neurogenesis (P = 4.43 × 10−9), behavioral response to cocaine processes (P = 1.84 × 10−7), and axon part (P = 5.26 × 10−8). We show that neuroticism’s genetic signal partly originates in two genetically distinguishable subclusters13 (‘depressed affect’ and ‘worry’), suggesting distinct causal mechanisms for subtypes of individuals. Mendelian randomization analysis showed unidirectional and bidirectional effects between neuroticism and multiple psychiatric traits.

Loss of network segregation between the default mode network and executive networks emerges as a common feature across all dimensions.

In partial contradiction to this widely held picture, we report resonant X-ray scattering measurements revealing incommensurate charge order reflections for overdoped (Bi,Pb)2.12Sr1.88CuO6+δ (Bi2201), with correlation lengths of 40–60 lattice units, that persist up to temperatures of at least 250 K.

In principle, a variety of factors can contribute to the response selectivity of a cortical neuron: the tuning and strength of excitatory1,2,3 and inhibitory synaptic inputs4,5,6, dendritic nonlinearities7,8,9 and spike threshold10,11. Here we use a combination of techniques including in vivo whole-cell recording, synaptic- and cellular-resolution in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) neuron-selective optogenetic manipulation to dissect the factors that contribute to the direction-selective responses of layer 2/3 neurons in ferret visual cortex (V1). Two-photon calcium imaging of dendritic spines12,13 revealed that each neuron receives a mixture of excitatory synaptic inputs selective for the somatic preferred or null direction of motion. The relative number of preferred- and null-tuned excitatory inputs predicted a neuron’s somatic direction preference, but failed to account for the degree of direction selectivity. By contrast, in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed a notable degree of direction selectivity in subthreshold responses that was significantly correlated with spiking direction selectivity. Subthreshold direction selectivity was predicted by the magnitude and variance of the response to the null direction of motion, and several lines of evidence, including conductance measurements, demonstrate that differential tuning of excitation and inhibition suppresses responses to the null direction of motion. Consistent with this idea, optogenetic inactivation of GABAergic neurons in layer 2/3 reduced direction selectivity by enhancing responses to the null direction. Furthermore, by optogenetically mapping connections of inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 in vivo, we find that layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons make long-range, intercolumnar projections to excitatory neurons that prefer the opposite direction of motion. We conclude that intracortical inhibition exerts a major influence on the degree of direction selectivity in layer 2/3 of ferret V1 by suppressing responses to the null direction of motion.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-018-0354-1", "authors": ["Daniel E.

To identify such cases, we analyzed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq profiles from stimulated primary CD4+ T cells in up to 105 healthy donors. We found that regions of accessible chromatin (ATAC-peaks) are co-accessible at kilobase and megabase resolution, consistent with the three-dimensional chromatin organization measured by in situ Hi-C in T cells. Fifteen percent of genetic variants located within ATAC-peaks affected the accessibility of the corresponding peak (local-ATAC-QTLs).

Here, we reveal the hitherto unknown interplay between reactive elements and water during alumina scale growth, causing a metastable ‘messy’ nano-structured alumina layer to form. We propose that reactive-element-decorated, hydroxylated interfaces between alumina nanograins enable water to access an inner cathode in the bottom of the scale, at odds with the established scale growth scenario. As evidence, hydride-nanodomains and reactive element/hydrogen (deuterium) co-variation are observed in the alumina scale.

Genetic analysis revealed that Rb but not p53 was required for the senescence response to altered ribosome biogenesis. Mechanistically, the ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14 or uS11) accumulates in the soluble non-ribosomal fraction of senescent cells, where it binds and inhibits CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4).

A key challenge is to quantify the functional roles of bacterial taxa in nature to understand how the properties of ecosystems change over time or under different environmental conditions2. Such knowledge could be used, for example, to understand how bacteria modulate biogeochemical cycles3, and to engineer bacterial communities to optimize desirable functional processes4. Communities of bacteria are, however, extraordinarily complex with hundreds of interacting taxa in every gram of soil and every millilitre of pond water5. Little is known about how the tangled interactions within natural bacterial communities mediate ecosystem functioning, but high levels of bacterial diversity have led to the assumption that many taxa are functionally redundant6. Here, we pinpoint the bacterial taxa associated with keystone functional roles, and show that rare and common bacteria are implicated in fundamentally different types of ecosystem functioning. By growing hundreds of bacterial communities collected from a natural aquatic environment (rainwater-filled tree holes) under the same environmental conditions, we show that negative statistical interactions among abundant phylotypes drive variation in broad functional measures (respiration, metabolic potential, cell yield), whereas positive interactions between rare phylotypes influence narrow functional measures (the capacity of the communities to degrade specific substrates). The results alter our understanding of bacterial ecology by demonstrating that unique components of complex communities are associated with different types of ecosystem functioning.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0180-0", "authors": ["Damian W.

Relative to the Holocene epoch, atmospheric carbon dioxide was about 100 parts per million lower and tropical sea surface temperatures were about 3 to 5 degrees Celsius lower2,3. The Last Glacial Maximum began when global mean sea level (GMSL) abruptly dropped by about 40 metres around 31,000 years ago4 and was followed by about 10,000 years of rapid deglaciation into the Holocene1. The masses of the melting polar ice sheets and the change in ocean volume, and hence in GMSL, are primary constraints for climate models constructed to describe the transition between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene, and future changes; but the rate, timing and magnitude of this transition remain uncertain. Here we show that sea level at the shelf edge of the Great Barrier Reef dropped by around 20 metres between 21,900 and 20,500 years ago, to −118 metres relative to the modern level. Our findings are based on recovered and radiometrically dated fossil corals and coralline algae assemblages, and represent relative sea level at the Great Barrier Reef, rather than GMSL. Subsequently, relative sea level rose at a rate of about 3.5 millimetres per year for around 4,000 years. The rise is consistent with the warming previously observed at 19,000 years ago1,5, but we now show that it occurred just after the 20-metre drop in relative sea level and the related increase in global ice volumes. The detailed structure of our record is robust because the Great Barrier Reef is remote from former ice sheets and tectonic activity. Relative sea level can be influenced by Earth’s response to regional changes in ice and water loadings and may differ greatly from GMSL. Consequently, we used glacio-isostatic models to derive GMSL, and find that the Last Glacial Maximum culminated 20,500 years ago in a GMSL low of about −125 to −130 metres.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-018-0335-4", "authors": ["Yusuke Yokoyama", "Tezer M.

We confirm that aspartate has poor cell permeability, which prevents environmental acquisition, whereas the related amino acid asparagine is available to cells in tumours, but cancer cells lack asparaginase activity to convert asparagine to aspartate. Heterologous expression of guinea pig asparaginase 1 (gpASNase1), an enzyme that produces aspartate from asparagine5, confers the ability to use asparagine to supply intracellular aspartate to cancer cells in vivo. Tumours expressing gpASNase1 grow at a faster rate, indicating that aspartate acquisition is an endogenous metabolic limitation for the growth of some tumours. Tumours expressing gpASNase1 are also refractory to the growth suppressive effects of metformin, suggesting that metformin inhibits tumour growth by depleting aspartate.

The latest example came in a New York Times piece (“As D.I.Y. gene editing gains popularity, 'someone is going to get hurt',” May 18, 2018) that conflated work to construct a horsepox virus from synthetic DNA fragments (PLoS ONE 13, e0188453, 2018) with “sounding the alarm about genetic tinkering carried out in garages and living rooms.” It did not matter that the horsepox experiments were carried out in a traditional academic laboratory at the University of Alberta and not in a garage or living room. Nor that the horsepox experiment did not use gene editing. Nor that there are few if any DIYbio spaces capable of carrying out the type of complex experiments required to reconstruct horsepox. The New York Times simply chose to link the DIYbio community with the controversial horsepox experiments to illustrate that “someone somewhere will use the spreading technology to create a bioweapon.”DIYbio is an easy target for scare stories because it remains something of an unknown. According to the Brookings Institution, there are over 169 DIYbio spaces and as many as 32,500 enthusiasts and followers around the world. These amateurs are part of a rapidly growing social movement in which citizen scientists come together to apply a set of hacking principles to biology—principles that include sharing, openness, decentralization, and free access, all with the goal of world improvement.Professional scientists often remain dismissive of biohackers, distrusting their lack of training, equipment, facilities, and know-how. Regulators are critical about DIYbio products and kits that enable self-experimentation and treatment—so-called body hacking. But it is law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that focus on biosecurity issues and the potential threat of DIYbio as a source of bioerror (accidental release) or bioterror (malign purpose).A catastrophic release via bioerror appears unlikely. Most biohackers work on Escherichia coli or yeast—organisms adapted to life in the laboratory and lacking the fitness to survive in the field.DIY bioterror also seems a long shot. If a rogue biohacker were to seek to create a pathogen from scratch using mail-order DNA fragments, for example, they would likely face a long, uphill struggle. Unlike David Evans' group at the University of Alberta who made the synthetic horsepox, a DIYbio hobbyist is unlikely to convince DNA synthesis companies like GeneArt to ship DNA flagged with “homology to a known pathogen” to their home address. Even if one assumes the biohacker could obtain pathogen DNA without being flagged, the likelihood is low they would have the necessary equipment, containment facilities, or know-how to create a synthetic pathogen (e.g., like horsepox) in their garage or living room. This is difficult work even for trained professional researchers with sophisticated instruments and technical and financial support provided by a traditional institution.A final aspect that seems to have escaped The New York Times journalists is the strong ethical, open, and transparent culture of DIYbio groups (e.g., see https://diybio.org/codes/) and their proactive attitude to addressing biosafety and biosecurity concerns. Most DIYbio activity is group-based, and these communities not only reinforce altruistic behavior but also would likely spot individuals with nefarious intentions working within their ranks.Of course, with all the above in mind, it is not impossible that a lone-wolf biohacker could make a synthetic pathogen. But it seems exceedingly unlikely—at least for now. DIYbio has a lot to offer the bioengineering community; it is disappointing that The New York Times sought to overhype its risks rather than explore the movement's potential for low-resource innovation, public engagement, and education.", "doi": "10.1038/nbt.4170", "authors": "", "_if": "", "issn": "1546-1696"},

We demonstrate that GLRX enzymatic activity was strongly decreased in fibrotic lungs, in accordance with increases in PSSG. Mice lacking Glrx were far more susceptible to bleomycin- or adenovirus encoding active transforming growth factor beta-1 (AdTGFB1)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, whereas transgenic overexpression of Glrx in the lung epithelium attenuated fibrosis. We furthermore show that endogenous GLRX was inactivated through an oxidative mechanism and that direct administration of the Glrx protein into airways augmented Glrx activity and reversed increases in collagen in mice with TGFB1- or bleomycin-induced fibrosis, even when administered to fibrotic, aged animals.

The biographies and careers of the previous awardees of the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience, physicists and chemists who have devoted their lives to manipulate matter and light at the nanoscale, tell a story that is quintessentially nanotechnological.With its roots in bacterial biology, this year’s Nanoscience Kavli award appears to depart slightly from the previous ones. This year’s prize invokes a tale of microscopic invasion and resistance, of a battle taking place at the nanoscale between bacteria and virus, and of human curiosity and inventiveness to understand first and to harness then the tools used in this battle. The 2018 Kavli Prize winners are Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Virginijus Šikšnys, a structural biologist, a microbiologist and a biochemist, for their work on CRISPR–Cas9.As for every scientific discovery, the one of the CRISPR–Cas9 bacterial system is the result of the collective feat of numerous scientists that spanned almost 30 years of research. These efforts showed that CRISPR–Cas9 represents a general immune system used by bacteria to fight off a viral attack. Bacteria integrate pieces of viral DNA in their genomes after they are invaded, building a memory of the event that triggers the CRISPR–Cas9 machinery in successive invasions. For a long time, however, the molecular mechanism of how the system worked remained obscure. It was only in 2012, in two seminal independent papers published a short time apart1,2, that the winners of this year’s Kavli prize described how Cas9 nuclease, guided by two RNA molecules that could be artificially fused together, identifies specific DNA sequences from invading species and cleaves them. Subsequent work from other groups showed that the CRISPR–Cas9 system could be used to cut a DNA sequence of choice in eukaryotic cells as well. At this point the scientific community fully realized that at its disposal was a genome editing technology that could be exploited in a variety of applications.The beauty, and power, of the technique resides in its relatively straightforward programmability and versatility, which makes it more accessible but also raises questions about lack of regulations on its use. While other gene editing techniques require laborious protein engineering efforts to adapt the system to different gene sequences, in CRISPR–Cas9 the information regarding its specificity are encoded in the guide RNA, which can be easily programmed to recognize any stretch of DNA. These characteristics have converted CRISPR–Cas9 into the molecular biology workhorse in labs worldwide, as, for example, it allows the investigation of gene function or the creation of specific animal models at a fraction of the time required by old-school protocols, speeding up research at unimaginable rates. A sustained growth in the number of scientific publications in the field has occurred since 2012, and new biotech and ‘gene programming’ companies delivering CRISPR kits or CRISPR-modified cell lines on demand have mushroomed. The promises of the new system are great. In medicine, for example, it might allow correction of faulty genes in otherwise incurable genetic diseases, and the first ex vivo genome editing clinical trials have already started in China for cancer treatment and will start in Europe and the United States for β-thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia. The technology might revolutionize other fields as well. In agriculture, CRISPR–Cas9 might deliver crops more resistant to adverse conditions, and in energy it might lead to genetically engineered organisms for increased production of biofuels. In the field of infectious diseases, the technology might facilitate gene drive, a technique that aims at controlling the number of pathogen-carrying organisms by spreading genome alteration in a population. For example, scientists seek to apply this technology to slash the population of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, but there are worries about the effect that this might have on the ecosystem.The application of CRISPR–Cas9 as a human genome editing tool poses serious social and ethical concerns among the scientific community, as its intentional or unintentional misuse and the advent of possible private interests could lead to disruptive and dire consequences. Since the methodology can be used to modify human embryos, strict regulations should be put in place to draw lines that define what can be done, and what should never be done with the technology. Indeed, a few years ago several scientists signed a moratorium to promote continuous discussion on the ethics involved in gene editing and to demand that certain CRISPR–Cas lines of investigation be paused until the system and its pitfalls are better elucidated and the regulatory apparatus catches up with research with appropriate guidelines and safety measures.As the ethical debate continues and the number of patents exploiting this technology increases, some scientists are going back to the bench to figure out more about the basics of the system. In particular, researchers want to know how the system has evolved, as well as understand its off-target effects and how to limit them. Some researchers have upgraded it to a yet more precise cutting device, engineering Cas9 proteins that can edit a gene at the level of a single base3 (the so called base editors), and others have tweaked it for molecular biology applications that go beyond gene editing4. Moreover, different CRISPR–Cas systems have been identified, with distinct substrate preferences and functions. Recently, three different groups have demonstrated the application of CRISPR–Cas12 and CRISPR–Cas13 systems for detection of viral DNA at extremely high sensitivities, a property that could lead to the engineering of low-cost portable devices for detection of infectious diseases in resource-limited settings5,6,7.The example of CRISPR–Cas shows that investing in basic science to understand the inner workings of the natural world is key to developing new solutions to human struggles. Nature is a trove of potential technologies — it’s up to the persistent and creative mind of man to find them, and to harness them responsibly.", "doi": "10.1038/s41565-018-0177-0", "authors": "", "_if": "", "issn": "1748-3395"},

We show that cost-neutral ‘mutations’ of the human connectome almost inevitably degrade its complexity and disconnect high-strength connections to prefrontal network hubs. Conversely, restoring the peripheral location and strong connectivity of empirically observed hubs confers a wiring cost that the brain appears to minimize. Progressive cost-neutral randomization yields daughter networks that differ substantially from one another and results in a topologically unstable phenomenon consistent with a phase transition in complex systems.

Here we show that stress exposure drives a rapid and persistent reduction of inhibitory transmission onto projection neurons of the posterior PVT (pPVT). This stress-induced disinhibition of the pPVT was associated with a locus coeruleus-mediated rise in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the midline thalamus, required the function of dopamine D2 receptors on PVT neurons, and increased sensitivity to stress. Our findings define the locus coeruleus as an important modulator of PVT function: by controlling the inhibitory tone of the pPVT, it modulates the excitability of pPVT projection neurons and controls stress responsivity.", "doi": "10.1038/s41593-018-0167-4", "authors": ["B.

Notably, we identified highly parcellated functions for dopamine neuron subpopulations projecting to different regions of striatum, revealing dissociable dopamine systems for the generation of incentive value and conditioned movement invigoration.

However, it is unknown whether Ca2+-dependent PKC isozymes are activated in dendritic spines during plasticity and, if so, how this synaptic activity is encoded by PKC. Here, using newly developed, isozyme-specific sensors, we demonstrate that classical isozymes are activated to varying degrees and with distinct kinetics. PKCα is activated robustly and rapidly in stimulated spines and is the only isozyme required for structural plasticity. This specificity depends on a PDZ-binding motif present only in PKCα. The activation of PKCα during plasticity requires both NMDA receptor Ca2+ flux and autocrine brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–TrkB signaling, two pathways that differ vastly in their spatiotemporal scales of signaling. Our results suggest that, by integrating these signals, PKCα combines a measure of recent, nearby synaptic plasticity with local synaptic input, enabling complex cellular computations such as heterosynaptic facilitation of plasticity necessary for efficient hippocampus-dependent learning.", "doi": "10.1038/s41593-018-0184-3", "authors": ["Lesley A Colgan", "Mo Hu", "Jaime A.

Cells utilize epigenetic defenses to limit transposable element jumping, including formation of silencing heterochromatin and generation of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small RNAs that facilitate clearance of transposable element transcripts. Here we utilize Drosophila melanogaster and postmortem human brain samples to identify transposable element dysregulation as a key mediator of neuronal death in tauopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders that are pathologically characterized by deposits of tau protein in the brain. Mechanistically, we find that heterochromatin decondensation and reduction of piwi and piRNAs drive transposable element dysregulation in tauopathy. We further report a significant increase in transcripts of the endogenous retrovirus class of transposable elements in human Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, suggesting that transposable element dysregulation is conserved in human tauopathy.

In return, the public wants to see real benefits, else the faucet risks running dry. These benefits can come in the form of fundamental advances or, in the case of applied research, of new technologies that can solve real-life problems.But assessing fundamental and applied research outputs are two separate trades. Fundamental research is mostly done by academics for other academics with the aim of making a contribution, however small, to our understanding of the laws of nature. Whether the taxpayer gets an intellectual benefit out of it is certainly desirable, but is not an immediate concern. Editors, science journalists and scientific institutions should be those helping the wider public to appreciate these kind of advances. The most impactful papers tend to get the highest number of citations, and this is one accepted way to measure their relevance.In contrast, for applied research, taxpayers should be able to appreciate real-life benefits far sooner than for fundamental research. These benefits can be measured by the number of jobs created, the amount of money saved through using a more efficient technology, the number of lives saved (for example for biomedical research), the productivity increase, the enjoyment arising from using a new gadget, and so on. The number of citations by other academics is rather irrelevant to the taxpayer.At Nature Nanotechnology, we publish a fair amount of papers reporting applied research, but we hardly ever look at how they have fared after publication. Yes, we might check the number of citations accrued, out of curiosity, but as mentioned this is not a relevant metric for real-life impact. We thought, therefore, that it would be interesting to look back at all the papers we have published since October 2006 (our first issue), and rank them in terms of the number of citations racked up in the patent literature. This is not quite real-life impact, but it is certainly a closer proxy than the number of citations in other scholarly publications. And it is also a relatively easy number to measure.We were very pleased to see that a range of topics in nanotechnology have resulted in patented technologies, some of which have also hit the market. In the top ten most-cited papers there are graphene and two-dimensional materials for flexible electronics, nanostructured materials for batteries, nanopores for DNA sequencing, nanowire-based transistors, nanocarriers for cancer therapy and memristive switching devices. It is important to note that the number of citations in patents does not correlate with the number of citations in scholarly literature, at least in our little sample. We were also reassured to see that the number of granted patents citing papers we are publishing is increasing from year to year (Fig. 1).With the help of colleagues at Nature Index, we obtained these numbers from a dedicated website, Lens.org, a free search engine that can be used to data-mine the patent literature1. The search we extracted our data from has been made freely available at the following link: https://www.lens.org/lens/scholar/search/results?collectionId=29157.During our search, we found out that there is no standard formatting for citations in patents, though tools such as the Lens are now making it easier to extract relevant data. In addition, the patent ontology seems more like a patched up maze than an organic hierarchical structure. To name a famous nanomaterial, it’s very hard to understand the difference in the following categories found in the Cooperative Patent Classification: “Graphene characterized by its properties” versus “Structure or properties of graphene”; or “Graphene oxide” versus “Graphene or derivatives, for example, graphene oxides” versus “Oxides Hydroxides graphene oxides”. Not to mention the presence of misnomers such as “grapheme” in some descriptions.Patents are a treasure trove of technical knowledge that academics can easily benefit from, but not many are able to search or read a patent, let alone the wider public. Tools like the Lens and others are now opening up the patent corpus to exploration by academics. Authors have the possibility to see which companies are using and citing their papers, offering them a direct link to industry they might not have been aware of. Additionally, authors can use patent citations as a pertinent metric for the impact of their research. Funding agencies too can benefit from these search tools when assessing the outcome of grants in applied fields.As a journal with a strong interest in technology, we are glad to see that some of the papers we have published contained the seed of new commercial products. In this issue, we present an interview with Jong-Hyun Ahn from Yonsei University in Seoul, Yi Cui form Stanford University and Hagan Bayley from Oxford University, the corresponding authors of the top three most-cited papers in the patent literature. They share insights about doing impactful applied research in academia. Publishing a good ‘applied’ paper is only the beginning of the journey — the distance between an academic paper and a successful technology is vast. Paraphrasing Jong-Hyun Ahn, any proposed new technology risks fading away without patient optimization work and dedication.", "doi": "10.1038/s41565-018-0215-y", "authors": "", "_if": "", "issn": "1748-3395"},

Here we show that microglia clearance activity in the adult brain is regionally regulated and depends on the rate of neuronal attrition. Cerebellar, but not striatal or cortical, microglia exhibited high levels of basal clearance activity, which correlated with an elevated degree of cerebellar neuronal attrition. Exposing forebrain microglia to apoptotic cells activated gene-expression programs supporting clearance activity.

Due to the uniquely crowded intermolecular forces under severe nanoconfinement (<2 nm), the transport behaviours of ions can be influenced by the interfacial electrical double layer (EDL) induced by a surface potential, with complex implications, engendering unusual ion dynamics5,6,7.

As a result, two new hybrid modes are formed that exhibit near-field enhancement effects. These hybrid modes have been exploited to improve light absorption in a number of systems. Here we show that this modal strong coupling between a Fabry–Pérot nanocavity mode and a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) facilitates water splitting reactions. We use a gold nanoparticle (Au-NP)/TiO2/Au-film structure as a photoanode. This structure exhibits modal strong coupling between the Fabry–Pérot nanocavity modes of the TiO2 thin film/Au film and LSPR of the Au NPs. Electronic excitation of the Au NPs is promoted by the optical hybrid modes across a broad range of wavelengths, followed by a hot electron transfer to TiO2. A key feature of our structure is that the Au NPs are partially inlaid in the TiO2 layer, which results in an enhancement of the coupling strength and water-oxidation efficiency. We observe an 11-fold increase in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency with respect to a photoanode structure with no Au film. Also, the internal quantum efficiency is enhanced 1.5 times under a strong coupling over that under uncoupled conditions.", "doi": "10.1038/s41565-018-0208-x", "authors": ["Xu Shi", "Kosei Ueno", "Tomoya Oshikiri", "Quan Sun", "Keiji Sasaki", "Hiroaki Misawa"], "_if": "", "issn": "1748-3395"},

To achieve such functions, the laborious, combinational networking of enzymes and substrate-genes is required, and to resolve problems, sophisticated design automation tools have been introduced2. However, the complexity of genetic circuits remains low because it is difficult to completely avoid crosstalk between the circuits. Here, we have made an orthogonal self-contained device by integrating an actuator and sensors onto a DNA origami-based nanochip that contains an enzyme, T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) and multiple target-gene substrates. This gene nanochip orthogonally transcribes its own genes, and the nano-layout ability of DNA origami allows us to rationally design gene expression levels by controlling the intermolecular distances between the enzyme and the target genes. We further integrated reprogrammable logic gates so that the nanochip responds to water-in-oil droplets and computes their small RNA (miRNA) profiles, which demonstrates that the nanochip can function as a gene logic-chip. Our approach to component integration on a nanochip may provide a basis for large-scale, integrated genetic circuits.", "doi": "10.1038/s41565-018-0202-3", "authors": ["Takeya Masubuchi", "Masayuki Endo", "Ryo Iizuka", "Ayaka Iguchi", "Dong Hyun Yoon", "Tetsushi Sekiguchi", "Hao Qi", "Ryosuke Iinuma", "Yuya Miyazono", "Shuichi Shoji", "Takashi Funatsu", "Hiroshi Sugiyama", "Yoshie Harada", "Takuya Ueda", "Hisashi Tadakuma"], "_if": "", "issn": "1748-3395"},

Ocular itch is generated mainly in the conjunctiva and is absent from the cornea. In contrast, most ocular pain arises from the cornea. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using genetic axonal tracing approaches, we discover distinct sensory innervation patterns between the conjunctiva and cornea. Further genetic and functional analyses in rodent models show that a subset of conjunctival-selective sensory fibers marked by MrgprA3 expression, rather than corneal sensory fibers, mediates ocular itch. Importantly, the actions of both histamine and nonhistamine pruritogens converge onto this unique subset of conjunctiva sensory fibers and enable them to play a key role in mediating itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis. This is distinct from skin itch, in which discrete populations of sensory neurons cooperate to carry itch. Finally, we provide proof of concept that selective silencing of conjunctiva itch-sensing fibers by pruritogen-mediated entry of sodium channel blocker QX-314 is a feasible therapeutic strategy to treat ocular itch in mice. Itch-sensing fibers also innervate the human conjunctiva and allow pharmacological silencing using QX-314.

To translate these findings into humans, we conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02372253) to assess the efficacy and safety of oral verapamil added for 12 months to a standard insulin regimen in adult subjects with recent-onset T1D.

Transplanting even fewer senescent cells had the same effect in older recipients and was accompanied by reduced survival, indicating the potency of senescent cells in shortening health- and lifespan. The senolytic cocktail, dasatinib plus quercetin, which causes selective elimination of senescent cells, decreased the number of naturally occurring senescent cells and their secretion of frailty-related proinflammatory cytokines in explants of human adipose tissue. Moreover, intermittent oral administration of senolytics to both senescent cell–transplanted young mice and naturally aged mice alleviated physical dysfunction and increased post-treatment survival by 36% while reducing mortality hazard to 65%.

Enasidenib treatment promoted hematopoietic differentiation from either terminal or ancestral mutant clones; less frequently, treatment promoted differentiation of nonmutant cells. Analysis of paired diagnosis/relapse samples did not identify second-site mutations in IDH2 at relapse. Instead, relapse arose by clonal evolution or selection of terminal or ancestral clones, thus highlighting multiple bypass pathways that could potentially be targeted to restore differentiation arrest. These results show how mapping of clonal structure in cell populations at different stages of differentiation can reveal the response and evolution of clones during treatment response and relapse.", "doi": "10.1038/s41591-018-0115-6", "authors": ["Lynn Quek", "Muriel D.

This phenomenon has been implicated in chemorefractory small cell lung cancer and resistance to targeted therapies5,6,7,8, but remains incompletely defined. Here, we identify a subclass of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) that engages innate immune signaling in these cells. Stimulated 3 prime antisense retroviral coding sequences (SPARCS) are oriented inversely in 3′ untranslated regions of specific genes enriched for regulation by STAT1 and EZH2. Derepression of these loci results in double-stranded RNA generation following IFN-γ exposure due to bi-directional transcription from the STAT1-activated gene promoter and the 5′ long terminal repeat of the antisense ERV. Engagement of MAVS and STING activates downstream TBK1, IRF3, and STAT1 signaling, sustaining a positive feedback loop. SPARCS induction in human tumors is tightly associated with major histocompatibility complex class 1 expression, mesenchymal markers, and downregulation of chromatin modifying enzymes, including EZH2. Analysis of cell lines with high inducible SPARCS expression reveals strong association with an AXL/MET-positive mesenchymal cell state. While SPARCS-high tumors are immune infiltrated, they also exhibit multiple features of an immune-suppressed microenviroment.

Mice deficient in either apelin or its receptor (APLNR) presented dramatic alterations in muscle function with increasing age.

Perforin delivers the antimicrobial peptide granulysin and death-inducing granzymes into the host cell, and granulysin then delivers granzymes into the parasite. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were thought to have no role against Plasmodium spp. blood stages because red blood cells generally do not express human leukocyte antigen class I7. However, P. vivax infects reticulocytes that retain the protein translation machinery. Here we show that P. vivax–infected reticulocytes express human leukocyte antigen class I. Infected patient circulating CD8+ T cells highly express cytotoxic proteins and recognize and form immunological synapses with P. vivax–infected reticulocytes in a human leukocyte antigen–dependent manner, releasing their cytotoxic granules to kill both host cell and intracellular parasite, preventing reinvasion. P. vivax–infected reticulocytes and parasite killing is perforin independent, but depends on granulysin, which generally efficiently forms pores only in microbial membranes8.

These data indicate a joint role for immunosurveillance by T cells and by B cells in epithelial tissues and suggest that IgE is part of the host defense against epithelial damage and tumor development.", "doi": "10.1038/s41590-018-0161-8", "authors": ["Greg Crawford", "Mark David Hayes", "Rocio Castro Seoane", "Sophie Ward", "Tim Dalessandri", "Chester Lai", "Eugene Healy", "David Kipling", "Charlotte Proby", "Colin Moyes", "Kile Green", "Katie Best", "Muzlifah Haniffa", "Marina Botto", "Deborah Dunn-Walters", "Jessica Strid"], "_if": "", "issn": "1529-2916"},

Our data revealed that strong ligands drove more efficient and uniform activation than did weak ligands, but all activated cells were fully cytolytic. Notably, activation followed the same transcriptional pathways regardless of ligand potency. Thus, stimulation strength did not intrinsically dictate the T cell–activation route or phenotype; instead, it controlled how rapidly and simultaneously the cells initiated activation, allowing limited machinery to elicit wide-ranging responses.", "doi": "10.1038/s41590-018-0160-9", "authors": ["Arianne C.

Despite limiting cell metabolism, continued Foxo1 activity is associated with increased activation of the kinase Akt and a cell-intrinsic proliferative advantage; however, survival and cell division are decreased in a competitive setting or growth-factor-limiting conditions.

{"title": "KBase: The United States Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4163", "source": "Nature Biotechnology 2018 36:7", "pub_date": "2018-07-06", "abstract": "To the Editor:Over the past two decades, the scale and complexity of genomics technologies and data have advanced from sequencing genomes of a few organisms to generating metagenomes, genome variation, gene expression, metabolites, and phenotype data for thousands of organisms and their communities. A major challenge in this data-rich age of biology is integrating heterogeneous and distributed data into predictive models of biological function, ranging from a single gene to entire organisms and their ecologies. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has invested substantially in efforts to understand the complex interplay between biological and abiotic processes that influence soil, water, and environmental dynamics of our biosphere. The community that has grown around these efforts recognizes the need for scientists of diverse backgrounds to have access to sophisticated computational tools that enable them to analyze complex and heterogeneous data sets and integrate their data and results effectively with the work of others. In this way, new data and conclusions can be rapidly propagated across existing, related analyses and easily discovered by the community for evaluation and comparison with previous results1,2,3.Here we present the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase, http://kbase.us), an open-source software and data platform that enables data sharing, integration, and analysis of microbes, plants, and their communities. KBase maintains an internal reference database that consolidates information from widely used external data repositories. This includes over 90,000 microbial genomes from RefSeq4, over 50 plant genomes from Phytozome5, over 300 Biolog media formulations6, and >30,000 reactions and compounds from KEGG7, BIGG8, and MetaCyc9. These public data are available for integration with user data where appropriate (e.g., genome comparison or building species trees). KBase links these diverse data types with a range of analytical functions within a web-based user interface. This extensive community resource facilitates large-scale analyses on scalable computing infrastructure and has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery, improve reproducibility, and foster open collaboration (Supplementary Note 1).Although similar integrative tools exist (Supplementary Note 2), no other open platform shares all KBase's features, which include the following: (i) comprehensive support for data provenance and analysis reproducibility; (ii) a flexible system for sharing data and workflows; (iii) an integrated database of genomes and biochemistry; (iv) a point-and-click interface that enables users to build, store, run, and share complex scientific analyses of fully integrated data; (v) built-in support for the use of custom code interleaved with point-and-click apps; and (vi) a software development kit that enables external developers to add applications to KBase (Supplementary Table 1). KBase has a suite of scientific applications that enables users to build and share sophisticated workflows. For example, a user can predict species interactions from metagenomic data by assembling raw reads, binning assembled contigs by species, annotating genomes, aligning RNA-seq reads, and reconstructing and analyzing individual and community metabolic models. KBase supports numerous branch points, alternative pipelines, alternative entry points, and internal curation loops that facilitate a wide range of scientific analyses, some of which are not available elsewhere (e.g., merging individual metabolic models into community models and using these to predict interspecies interactions). Although KBase was developed to support analysis of microbes, plants, and their communities, it is potentially applicable to any area of science. There is, however, a policy on use restriction for projects that require HIPAA compliance.KBase's primary user interface, the Narrative Interface, provides a user experience distinct from other analysis platforms available today, although it shares some common features with a few other systems (Supplementary Note 2). From this interface, which is built on the Jupyter10,11 platform, users can upload their private data, search and retrieve extensive public reference data, access data shared by others, share their data with others, select and run applications on their data, view and analyze the results from those applications, and record their thoughts and interpretations along with the analysis steps. These activities take place within a point-and-click 'notebook' environment (Fig. 1). When a user begins a new computational experiment in KBase, they create a new 'notebook' (referred to as a Narrative in KBase) to hold this experiment. Every action performed by a user appears as a 'cell' in the Narrative. App cells show the chosen input parameters for the application and the results of the analysis. Markdown cells allow users to add formatted text and figures to a Narrative to describe the thought process behind the scientific workflow being crafted.A finished Narrative is a precise record of everything the authors did to complete their analysis. Although Narratives are private by default, users may choose to make their Narratives public, or share them with other individual users. This recording of a user's KBase activities within a sharable Narrative is a central pillar of KBase's support for reproducible, transparent research (Supplementary Note 1). Once a Narrative has been shared or made public, other users can copy the Narrative and rerun it on their own data, or modify it to suit their scientific needs. Thus, public Narratives serve as resources for the user community by capturing valuable data sets, associated computational analyses, and scientific context describing the rationale behind a scientific study in a form that is immediately reproducible and reusable. A growing number of public Narratives are available in KBase, some of which are showcased in the Narrative Library (https://kbase.us/narrative-library/).The data model in KBase is fundamental to supporting reproducibility and collaboration. KBase is built upon an object-oriented data model where each object instance is automatically versioned and linked to provenance information describing how it was generated. Each data object is also associated with the specific Narrative in which it was uploaded or generated. When a Narrative is shared or copied, all its input and output data are shared or copied with it. Currently supported data types include reads, contigs, genomes, metabolic models, growth media, RNA-seq, expression, growth phenotype data, and flux balance analysis solutions. This set of types can be extended to support new apps and functionality.Many existing systems (Supplementary Note 2) provide similar support for object-level sharing and provenance, but these systems operate on raw files only, without integration into a common data model. In KBase, objects are not simple files—they are explicitly defined and validated data structures, within which associated objects are linked to one another. For example, a metabolic model IS linked to its associated genome, which is linked to its associated taxonomy. This data model enhances interoperability by requiring apps to operate on a common data representation. Furthermore, it enhances awareness of interdependence so users can be notified when an object on which an analysis is based has been updated, and it will ultimately enable data discovery and meta-analysis across the KBase platform.Presently, KBase has over 160 apps (https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog) offering diverse scientific functionality for (meta)genome assembly, contig binning, genome annotation, sequence homology analysis, tree building, comparative genomics, metabolic modeling, community modeling, gap-filling, RNA-seq processing, and expression analysis (see Supplementary Note 2 for references). Apps interoperate seamlessly to enable a range of scientific workflows (Fig. 2). For reproducibility, all apps in KBase are containerized in versioned Docker modules, enabling a user to run any version at any time.In addition to running apps, users can create and run blocks of code within a Narrative using “code cells.” KBase has an application-programming interface (API) that allows users to call any KBase app programmatically from within these code cells. This enables users to, for example, run large-scale studies in KBase (e.g., building thousands of models at once) by using loops within a code cell (Supplementary Note 1; Fig. 1). Users can also leverage the flexibility of code cells to add custom analysis steps that are not yet available as KBase apps.Although there are other systems that allow users to create workflows consisting of a series of analysis tool runs and code blocks, the app functionality in KBase differs from these systems in several ways (Supplementary Note 2). Currently, KBase's capabilities for community model reconstruction, plant model reconstruction, community model gap-filling, and expression data model integration are unique to the KBase platform (Supplementary Note 1; Fig. 2).KBase was designed to be an extensible community resource. This extensibility is supported by the KBase Software Development Kit (SDK), which is a set of command-line tools and a web interface that enable any developer to build, test, register, and deploy new or existing software as KBase apps, thereby extending the platform's scientific capabilities. All software contributed to the central KBase software repository must adhere to a standard open-source license (https://opensource.org/licenses). Information about the app developer is maintained in the documentation for that app so credit can be given to the contributor. Data provenance, job management, usage logging, and app versioning are handled automatically by the platform, allowing developers with minimal training to package scientific tools in a form that makes them accessible to users within KBase. Other existing platforms offer similar support for third-party development (Supplementary Note 2), but KBase's data model provides the additional benefit of improving interoperability of third-party applications by imposing a single data format and specification on all data types consumed or produced by each app. More information about the KBase SDK is available at https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk/blob/master/README.md.Many users have already discovered and applied KBase to meet their scientific needs. As of September 2017, over 3,000 users have KBase accounts, and users have created over 5,000 Narratives. These Narratives contain a total of over 250,000 data objects, or an average of 96 data objects and five apps per Narrative. Science done within Kbase, which has been published in over 30 peer-reviewed publications (Supplementary Note 1; http://kbase.us/publications), includes reconstruction of >8,000 models of core metabolism across the microbial tree of life12, reconstruction of semi-curated metabolic models for 773 gut microbes13, prediction of trophic interactions within a microbial community14, and reconstruction of regulons from expression data15.Much of the research performed within KBase has been publicly shared as Narratives that any user can view, copy, and rerun. Through these public Narratives, scientists can rapidly follow the examples set by their peers to apply similar approaches to new data and scenarios. Thus KBase goes beyond supporting reproducible science to enabling rapid repurposing, reapplication, and extension of scientific techniques. As more users apply the system to address their scientific questions, and share their resulting Narratives, KBase will have a continually growing body of experiments, results, and scientific use cases that can be adapted and extended by other researchers.KBase's integration of data and tools and the ease of creating and running large-scale analysis workflows have the potential to empower scientists in a broad range of application areas for systems biology, including environmental analysis, biosystems design, and human health. KBase's sharing capabilities amplify this potential by enabling scientists with differing expertise to easily work together and leverage each other's work (Supplementary Note 1; Supplementary Fig. 3).Future development of KBase will build upon the concept of KBase as a knowledgebase. The social aspects of the platform will be enhanced, enabling scientists to discover colleagues with complementary talents. New data-discovery features will allow the platform to suggest data sets and Narratives that may be of interest to a particular user, based on interconnections found in the data in KBase. These features will ultimately evolve into knowledge-discovery features, enabling KBase to propose new hypotheses by making connections across the system.

{"title": "Wanted: a reward for antibiotic development", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4193", "source": "Nature Biotechnology 2018 36:7", "pub_date": "2018-07-06", "abstract": "At the end of May, the Nature conference “Countering Antimicrobial Resistance” in Beijing, China, showcased a wide array of discovery approaches focused on combatting drug-resistant bacteria. On the one hand, the sheer diversity of candidate treatments on show—from novel antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides and peptide fusions, therapeutic antibodies, microbiome treatments, CRISPR anti-infectives to therapeutic vaccines—was encouraging. On the other, several speakers warned that few of these interventions are likely to reach patients unless more is done to address the continued market failure of antibiotics. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration laid out its agenda for addressing the problem of antibiotic reimbursement. But real progress in galvanizing product development will likely require governments and international agencies to undertake a coordinated, collective, global effort that offers industry tangible financial rewards for entering the marketplace.According to the AMR Review, a 2016 UK government report on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) funded by the Wellcome Trust, at least 700,000 people die annually owing to drug-resistant pathogens. In recent years, 'superbugs', such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extremely drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have been joined in hospitals or community settings by Gram-negative organisms, such as carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By 2050, based on the current rate of antibiotic approvals, the UK report estimates that drug-resistant superbugs could kill up to 10 million people.Paradoxically, as this AMR problem grows, commercial incentives for industry to develop new antibiotics are diminishing.At the Nature event, promising early clinical data was presented on a new monobactam derivative (LYS228) from Novartis; and yet the company is currently seeking to outlicense the asset. A similar story can be seen across big pharma; only Merck & Co., Roche, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer now have active antibiotic programs, and only 12 antibiotics have been approved since 2000—a decision on Achaogen's plazomicin was expected as Nature Biotechnology went to press.Manufacturers are deserting novel antibiotic development for several reasons. Recruiting patients for trials is both laborious and challenging because clinical centers move to quickly contain AMR outbreaks. Demonstrating clinical benefit in a reasonable timeframe is also challenging due to the sporadic nature of AMR and the difficulty of demonstrating the superiority of a novel agent over an existing, curative antibiotic. From a business standpoint, standard drug reimbursement, which links return on investment to the volume of drug sold, simply doesn't work for antibiotics.Faced with a dwindling antibacterial pipeline, governments have scrambled to plough more funding into R&D—so-called push incentives. For example, the European Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance, the Innovative Medicine Initiative's (IMI) New Drugs for Bad Bugs program, the Global Antibiotics Research and Development Partnership, Novo Holdings' REPAIR Impact Fund and the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X) initiative will collectively inject over $1 billion between 2014 and 2021.But these incentives are focused on drug R&D rather than supporting the market after approval. No one has successfully deployed the missing piece to the puzzle: a strong market pull incentive.Last month, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb publicly acknowledged that the antibiotic market was broken, requiring a large pull incentive. He went on to propose a specific pull mechanism—a model in which acute-care institutions would pay a fixed licensing fee in return for access to a certain number of annual doses of a new antibiotic. Although it is encouraging that the agency is thinking about market incentives, negotiating contracts with thousands of medical centers, long-term care facilities and private payers (all currently incentivized to cut costs) seems rather impractical.Other promising market incentives remain on the table, however.DRIVE-AB, an IMI project specifically looking at the economics of antibiotic development, reviewed many pull mechanisms, including priority review vouchers and transfers of intellectual property rights (TIPR). The former have proven popular in neglected disease research, where a drug approval is awarded with a voucher that can be used to obtain priority review for another drug (such vouchers can be sold on to other manufacturers and priority review transferred). In contrast, TIPRs reward an approval with an exclusivity period (say 12 months) that is transferrable from the new antibiotic to another drug (e.g., a blockbuster), fending off generic competition.In the final DRIVE-AB report, neither of these incentives won out. Instead, the 'market entry reward' (MER) was put forward. This is an award made to a drug developer in return for the approval of a novel antibiotic that meets a predefined target product profile (e.g., new target class, important medical need). DRIVE-AB estimates that a MER should be valued between $750 million and $2,000 million, paid out in installments over five years. And this concept may be reduced to practice. Already, the 2006 Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act, which is being prepared for reauthorization by the US Congress, contains provisions that would give the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) the ability to provide MERs for new antimicrobials addressing urgent unmet needs. Such MERs may be financed by TIPRs rather than general appropriations, giving companies more assurance of a reward once their drug passes the finish line in the years ahead.That sounds like a step in the right direction. But AMR is global, not local. Europe and Asia must also embrace MER incentives if the range of antibiotic discovery research on display at the Nature Conference is to realize its potential. What is needed now is to convince industry that there are sufficient rewards to justify the considerable investment in developing these candidates into antimicrobial products of the future.", "doi": "10.1038/nbt.4193", "authors": "", "_if": "", "issn": "1546-1696"},

Moreover, reduced ZIKV RNA is present in the placenta and fetuses of ZIKV-infected DENV-immune dams.

Endurance exercise stimulates improvements in muscle oxidative capacity, while resistance exercise induces muscle growth. Here we show that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a molecular switch that when active, stimulates muscle fibers to grow, resulting in increased muscle mass. Conversely, when muscle JNK activation is suppressed, an alternative remodeling program is initiated, resulting in smaller, more oxidative muscle fibers, and enhanced aerobic fitness. When muscle is exposed to mechanical stress, JNK initiates muscle growth via phosphorylation of the transcription factor, SMAD2, at specific linker region residues leading to inhibition of the growth suppressor, myostatin. In human skeletal muscle, this JNK/SMAD signaling axis is activated by resistance exercise, but not endurance exercise. We conclude that JNK acts as a key mediator of muscle remodeling during exercise via regulation of myostatin/SMAD signaling.", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-05439-3", "authors": ["Sarah J.

Finally, we used H3K27ac levels at active enhancer elements as a surrogate of intra-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity to track the expansion and contraction of phenotypic subpopulations throughout breast cancer progression. By tracking the clonality of SLC9A3R1-positive cells, a bona fide YY1-ERα-regulated gene, we show that endocrine therapies select for phenotypic clones under-represented at diagnosis. Collectively, our data show that epigenetic mechanisms significantly contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity and evolution in systemically treated breast cancer patients.", "doi": "10.1038/s41591-018-0091-x", "authors": ["Darren K.

In this issue of Nature Neuroscience, Victor et al.1 describe an effect of aging that elicits specific pathological phenotypes in cells derived from patients with Huntington’s disease (HD). In doing so, they have created an improved model of this devastating neurological disorder.HD is caused by the presence of 36 or more CAG trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene1, with symptoms including involuntary movements, motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment, psychiatric abnormalities and eventual death2. The number of repeats is correlated with age of onset and severity2. Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) display mutant HTT protein aggregation and are selectively vulnerable to death, although at later stages of disease the cortex and other brain regions are also affected. While there are juvenile-onset cases of HD associated with very long repeat lengths (>60), in most cases this disease is primarily an adult-onset disorder for which there are no current treatments. In vitro models of HD could facilitate the discovery of therapies, but these have been challenging to develop using human tissues. Disease-in-a-dish modeling of adult neurodegenerative diseases often generate neurons from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)3, which have been reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like ‘young’ state4. In effect, reprogramming wipes clean most of the epigenetic marks of aging. Differentiation protocols that mimic human development are used to differentiate iPSCs into MSNs. iPSC models generated from juvenile-onset HD with more than 60 CAG repeats display strong CAG-length-dependent phenotypes. However, perhaps not surprisingly, many pathways disrupted in these models are associated with development3. In contrast, most iPSC-derived lines with under 60 CAG repeats have no major observable phenotypes, such as aggregate formation or cell death3, indicating that modeling an adult-onset disorder might require the maintenance of signatures of aging.Direct reprogramming of adult fibroblasts into neurons, accomplished using transcription factors expressed during neurogenesis and/or specific microRNAs (miR9/9* and miR124)5, provided a breakthrough method for producing neurons from aged tissues6. With the addition of MSN-specific transcription factors (Ctip2, DLX1 and DLX2), these microRNAs were even able to directly convert human fibroblasts specifically to a MSN fate7. Unlike iPSC-derived cells, directly reprogrammed cells retain aging-related signatures, such as age-specific transcriptional profiles (including a decrease of RanBP17 expression), nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization8 and an aged DNA methylation epigenetic clock9. This begets the question: what impact would the maintenance of these signatures of aging have on adult-onset disease modeling? Victor et al.1 now report the direct reprogramming of control and HD patient fibroblasts into MSNs1. Remarkably, HD neurons generated in this manner displayed both inclusion-body formation and cell death, mirroring what is seen in the striatum of individuals with HD.Victor et al.1 collected HD fibroblasts, with a range of 40–180 CAG repeats, as well as control fibroblasts, and directly converted them into MSNs using miR9/9*-124 with Ctip2, DLX1, DLX2 and Myt1L (miR9/9*-124 + CDM). After 30 days, regardless of the CAG length, 70–80% of fibroblasts became MSNs. The MSNs from symptomatic HD patients in the adult onset range (40–47 CAGs) displayed characteristic phenotypes seen in HD postmortem MSNs, such as HTT aggregates, DNA damage, mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction, and cell death (Fig. 1). Notably, HD-MSNs differentiated from iPSC-derived fibroblasts with 40 CAGs did not display the phenotypes observed in the directly converted aged HD-MSNs, suggesting that reprogramming erases essential aging characteristics required for the death of the MSNs. In addition, directly reprogrammed presymptomatic HD patient fibroblasts showed a less severe phenotype than their aged counterparts, while still having similar levels of mutant HTT aggregates.To address the neuronal type-specificity of this effect, the authors next directly converted HD fibroblasts into cortical neurons using miR9/9*-124, NeuroD2, ASCL1 and MYT1L. While HTT aggregates were observed, the DNA damage and cell death phenotypes were lost, suggesting that these were specific to the aged MSN populations, supporting the early vulnerability of these neurons in HD. Finally, Victor et al.1 showed that mRNA for SP9, a transcription factor required for the development of MSNs, is downregulated in the directly converted HD-MSNs and that SP9 overexpression can rescue the HD-MSNs from cell death.The key finding of this article is that using aged fibroblasts as the starting source for neurons provided hallmark phenotypes of HD such as HTT aggregate formation and cell death in HD-MSN samples without requiring stressors such as proteasome inhibition for induction or specialized single-cell tracking equipment for detection3. These results corroborate a previous report that showed HTT aggregates and cell death in MSN-like neurons directly converted from HD fibroblasts using short hairpin RNA knockdown of PTB110. However, in the earlier study, as with prior reports of disease-in-a-dish models for HD, the patient fibroblasts used for direct conversion were from juvenile-onset patients, with 68 and 86 repeats. In contrast, Victor et al.1 used patient fibroblasts with repeat lengths in the 40s and still showed pronounced phenotypes in these adult-onset HD-MSNs. It will be interesting to observe whether the number of CAG repeats and/or disease-onset information correlates with the severity of the HD-MSN cell death phenotypes and whether reprogramming to iPSCs reverses it, as this would be a powerful validation of the assay3.A potential limitation of direct conversion is the consistent availability of patient primary tissue. The limited expansion potential of fibroblasts due to senescence over time11 and their genomic instability in culture may hinder large-scale ‘omics’ studies requiring abundant tissue and collaborative projects with cell distribution across laboratories. In contrast, iPSCs provide a limitless source of tissue that can be differentiated into the cell type of interest. While Victor et al.1 showed that reprogrammed iPSCs cannot faithfully model aged HD phenotypes, an aging strategy may be able to circumvent this limitation. For instance, overexpression of the ‘aging’ gene encoding progerin has been used in an iPSC-based in vitro model of Parkinson’s disease12. Ideally, transcriptomic data from directly converted neurons that were responsible for the toxic effect of mutant HTT could elucidate key aging-related genes or epigenetic signatures required for cell death and thus suggest a more defined transcriptomic or epigenetic ‘roadmap’ for inducing in vitro aging and disease-specific phenotypes.One concern in using these directly converted HD-MSNs is their rapid degeneration in culture, with MSN generation at day 30 and onset of death at day 35. While the authors found that treatment with KU600019 significantly reduced cell death, the limited time window in which to influence disease progression may minimize this cellular platform’s utility for drug screening. Another concern using aged HD-MSNs is, ironically, that the involvement of early development is overlooked. This is critical given that both rodent and patient-derived iPSC models of HD have shown that development is important to HD manifestation3,13. As such, iPSC models that replay development may still be required to fully understand this disorder. Fortunately, the growing field of MSN generation can provide various in vitro models to use based on the specific question.Still to be addressed is the finding that the MSN death phenotypes occurred in the absence of other neuronal cells (such as cortical cells or interneurons) or support cells (such as astrocytes or microglia). This suggests an MSN-autonomous mechanism of mutant HTT toxicity, at least in this in vitro system. Direct conversion was used here to generate cortical neurons and has been successfully used to generate astrocytes14. Given that support cells and other neuronal subtypes play a role in HD15, future studies could co-culture HD-MSNs with other directly converted cell types to assess protective or deleterious effects.Even after years of HD research, certain disease aspects remain unresolved, including the specific role of mutant HTT aggregation and the selective vulnerability of MSNs, and no US Food and Drug Association–approved therapeutic exists. This is partly because animal models are limited in their ability to recapitulate the human disease. Victor et al.1 have recapitulated key phenotypes of HD in MSNs directly converted from aged adult-onset HD fibroblasts of both preonset and symptomatic patients. This represents a significant breakthrough for the field of adult disease modeling and should provide a powerful platform for drug screening on a human cell type relevant to the disease. These findings now need to be reproduced by other laboratories, and hopefully this in vitro model will be able to complement animal models to fully understand the pathogenesis of HD, ultimately leading to a successful therapy.", "doi": "10.1038/s41593-018-0086-4", "authors": ["Virginia B.

{"title": "Celebrating 20 years of Nature Neuroscience", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0146-9", "source": "Nature Neuroscience 2018 21:5", "pub_date": "2018-04-25", "abstract": "This is an exciting time for neuroscience. Worldwide initiatives have promoted investment in research, with new technologies being developed at a rapid pace. This has spurred basic discoveries and provided insights into all areas of neuroscience. Several consortia and team science initiatives are working collaboratively to generate large datasets across multiple modalities and scales. This has created a wealth of data which can be mined and integrated and can provide insights for further hypothesis testing.As we look back over the past 20 years, we can take stock at how privileged our journal has been. We’ve received over 50,000 submissions and published almost 4,000 articles. As the publishing landscape has changed, so have we, implementing changes to meet the needs of our authors and readers and championing policies to encourage transparent reporting and reproducibility. These have been rolled out at every stage, from initial editorial consideration to peer review and postpublication.Over five years ago, we introduced guidelines and a reporting checklist to improve reporting of methods, data collection, and analyses in our pages1. Full transparency surrounding methodology, as well as explicit declarations of what has not been done, are necessary and benefit both reviewers and readers. This reporting summary has since been expanded to include technique-specific modules, including one for MRI research2. Prior to peer review we also ask that authors, where possible, replace bar plots with dot-plots or box-and-whisker plots to provide a clearer representation of the data points and distribution, and we require a data availability statement.Innovations have also been introduced into our peer review process. Inspired by efforts at other journals, we introduced a consultative dimension to peer review. We routinely aim to identify any referee requests that we may overrule on editorial grounds. At our editorial discretion, if some discrepancies between referee reports are identified, these anonymous reports are shared with all of the referees before a decision is issued. They are then given the chance to weigh-in on their peers’ concerns and can update their reports to comment on these issues. The aim is to provide a prioritized list of requests, and identify any that are out of scope, to guide the revision, or to provide a clear rationale for rejecting the manuscript. Additionally, although a code availability statement is required, we now request that custom code be shared as well, and may ask reviewers to assess whether the code is accessible, executable, and accurately reproduces key findings in the paper3.We have also introduced new article formats. In our first ten years we introduced Technical Reports and Resources. We’ve recently published Viewpoints, which seek to identify major topics of contention where several individuals with opposing views can provide their input4. A moderator provides a series of open questions to these experts, additional questions are posed, and a set of key themes for future research emerges. We have also published several pieces focused on data quality and sharing for a particular technique. These are typically authored by several researchers, with the goal of providing guidance on experimental design, data acquisition, and data sharing, alongside ways to mitigate sources of error, reduce variability, and improve data quality. If some consensus can be reached, these are detailed with best practices and future directions.Our journal was the first Nature journal to publish with full online content, and we have continued to develop our web presence. Integrated supplementary information, which displays supplementary figures alongside main figures, has improved the visibility of additional data and provides a fuller picture of the paper’s important findings. Articles are also promoted through various online channels, and particularly via our Twitter account (https://twitter.com/natureneuro), where we highlight recent content, along with key data, schematics, and recent coverage in the popular media.To commemorate the past 20 years, we will be reflecting back on what we have published, revisiting key articles and topics each month with Historical News and Views beginning with our June 2018 issue. In particular, what did it mean for the field when a particular original study was published? Did it resolve an unanswered question? Was a new line of inquiry launched which we can still appreciate today? Were commonly-held assumptions overturned? And, looking forward, what’s to come in this field? These are somewhat lofty goals for a short piece, but a lot can and should be learned by taking a close look at seminal papers.We anticipate these papers will continue to inform new research directions. Moving forward, we are excited at the prospect of what’s to come. Alongside our original Articles and Brief Communications, we welcome Technical Reports describing new tools and analysis pipelines for interrogating cells and circuits at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. Genetics and genomics studies have provided a window into the diversity of cell types and the heterogeneity of disease. These studies, alongside work focused on (but not limited to) connectomics and multimodal population-based cohorts, often result in Resources, a format that describes large datasets of broad community interest which we champion. Neuroscience continues to be increasingly interdisciplinary as we appreciate the interactions between systems. Translational studies identifying biomarkers, tracking longitudinal cohorts, and providing insight into pathogenesis and novel therapies are transforming our understanding and treatment of disease. We’re also at the cusp of important innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and network science, and recognize that these fields will continue to mature with insights gained from basic neuroscience.To all of our authors, reviewers and readers: thank you. We look forward to receiving your work and championing burgeoning areas of interest. Despite the rapid evolution and growth of the field, reflecting back on our first editorial5, it’s important to realize that our primary goal remains the same: to publish a select number of papers of broad interest and significance to the field, across all areas of neuroscience. We need to remain agile, keep evolving and serve our whole community. To quote that 1998 editorial: “neuroscience still has a ‘frontier’ feel to it.

Infections often occur without symptoms, a feature that has been attributed to the ability of the pathogen to evade the host immune response. We show here that C. trachomatis paralyses the host immune system by preventing the activation of polymorphic nuclear leukocytes (PMNs). PMNs infected with Chlamydia fail to produce neutrophil extracellular traps and the bacteria are able to survive in PMNs for extended periods of time. We have identified the secreted chlamydial protease-like activating factor (CPAF) as an effector mediating the evasion of the innate immune response since CPAF-deficient Chlamydia activate PMNs and are subsequently efficiently killed. CPAF suppresses the oxidative burst and interferes with chemical-mediated activation of neutrophils. We identified formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) as a target of CPAF. FPR2 is cleaved by CPAF and released from the surface of PMNs. In contrast to previously described subversion mechanisms that mainly act on already activated PMNs, we describe here details of how Chlamydia actively paralyses PMNs, including the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, to evade the host’s innate immune response.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0182-y", "authors": ["Karthika Rajeeve", "Sudip Das", "Bhupesh K.

Emphasis has been placed on prevention of pathogen dominance by competing microflora acting as probiotics1. Here we show that the virulence of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is augmented by native, polymicrobial, commensal skin flora and individual species acting as ‘proinfectious agents’. The outcome is pathogen proliferation, but not commensal. Pathogenesis augmentation can be mediated by particulate cell wall peptidoglycan, reducing the S. aureus infectious dose by over 1,000-fold. This phenomenon occurs using a range of S. aureus strains and infection models and is not mediated by established receptor-mediated pathways including Nod1, Nod2, Myd88 and the NLPR3 inflammasome. During mouse sepsis, augmentation depends on liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) that capture and internalize both the pathogen and the proinfectious agent, leading to reduced production of reactive oxygen species, pathogen survival and subsequent multiple liver abscess formation. The augmented infection model more closely resembles the natural situation and establishes the role of resident environmental microflora in the initiation of disease by an invading pathogen. As the human microflora is ubiquitous2, its role in increasing susceptibility to infection by S. aureus highlights potential strategies for disease prevention.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0198-3", "authors": ["Emma Boldock", "Bas G.

The parasite elicits robust antibody-mediated immune responses to its variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat, but evades immune clearance by repeatedly accessing a large genetic VSG repertoire and ‘switching’ to antigenically distinct VSGs. This persistent immune evasion has been ascribed exclusively to amino-acid variance on the VSG surface presented by a conserved underlying protein architecture. We establish here that this model does not account for the scope of VSG structural and biochemical diversity. The 1.4-Å-resolution crystal structure of the variant VSG3 manifests divergence in the tertiary fold and oligomeric state. The structure also reveals an O-linked carbohydrate on the top surface of VSG3. Mass spectrometric analysis indicates that this O-glycosylation site is heterogeneously occupied in VSG3 by zero to three hexose residues and is also present in other VSGs. We demonstrate that this O-glycosylation increases parasite virulence by impairing the generation of protective immunity. These data alter the paradigm of antigenic variation by the African trypanosome, expanding VSG variability beyond amino-acid sequence to include surface post-translational modifications with immunomodulatory impact.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0187-6", "authors": ["Jason Pinger", "Dragana Nešić", "Liaqat Ali", "Francisco Aresta-Branco", "Mirjana Lilic", "Shanin Chowdhury", "Hee-Sook Kim", "Joseph Verdi", "Jayne Raper", "Michael A.

In Myxococcus xanthus, MglA, a G protein, and MglB, its cognate GTPase-activating protein, establish a polarity axis that defines the direction of movement of the cell and that can be rapidly inverted by the Frz chemosensory system. Although vital for collective cell behaviours, how Frz triggers this switch has remained unknown. Here, we use genetics, imaging and mathematical modelling to show that Frz controls polarity reversals via a gated relaxation oscillator. FrzX, which we identify as a target of the Frz kinase, provides the gating and thus acts as the trigger for reversals. Slow relocalization of the polarity protein RomR then creates a refractory period during which another switch cannot be triggered. A secondary Frz output, FrzZ, decreases this delay, allowing rapid reversals when required. Thus, this architecture results in a highly tuneable switch that allows a wide range of reversal frequencies.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0203-x", "authors": ["Mathilde Guzzo", "Seán M.

Representative genome-sequenced culture collections of bacterial isolates from model plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, have recently been established. These resources provide opportunities for systematic interaction screens combined with genome mining to discover uncharacterized natural products. Here, we report on the biosynthetic potential of 224 strains isolated from the A. thaliana phyllosphere. Genome mining identified more than 1,000 predicted natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), hundreds of which are unknown compared to the MIBiG database of characterized BGCs. For functional validation, we used a high-throughput screening approach to monitor over 50,000 binary strain combinations. We observed 725 inhibitory interactions, with 26 strains contributing to the majority of these. A combination of imaging mass spectrometry and bioactivity-guided fractionation of the most potent inhibitor, the BGC-rich Brevibacillus sp.

As oceans warm, the area of phosphate-limited surface waters is predicted to increase, resulting in ocean desertification3,4. Understanding the responses of key eukaryotic phytoplankton to nutrient limitation is therefore critical5,6. We used advanced photo-bioreactors to investigate how the widespread marine green alga Micromonas commoda grows under transitions from replete nutrients to chronic phosphate limitation and subsequent relief, analysing photosystem changes and broad cellular responses using proteomics, transcriptomics and biophysical measurements. We find that physiological and protein expression responses previously attributed to stress are critical to supporting stable exponential growth when phosphate is limiting. Unexpectedly, the abundance of most proteins involved in light harvesting does not change, but an ancient light-harvesting-related protein, LHCSR, is induced and dissipates damaging excess absorbed light as heat throughout phosphate limitation. Concurrently, a suite of uncharacterized proteins with narrow phylogenetic distributions increase multifold. Notably, of the proteins that exhibit significant changes, 70% are not differentially expressed at the mRNA transcript level, highlighting the importance of post-transcriptional processes in microbial eukaryotes. Nevertheless, transcript–protein pairs with concordant changes were identified that will enable more robust interpretation of eukaryotic phytoplankton responses in the field from metatranscriptomic studies. Our results show that P-limited Micromonas responds quickly to a fresh pulse of phosphate by rapidly increasing replication, and that the protein network associated with this ability is composed of both conserved and phylogenetically recent proteome systems that promote dynamic phosphate homeostasis. That an ancient mechanism for mitigating light stress is central to sustaining growth during extended phosphate limitation highlights the possibility of interactive effects arising from combined stressors under ocean change, which could reduce the efficacy of algal strategies for optimizing marine photosynthesis.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0178-7", "authors": ["Jian Guo", "Susanne Wilken", "Valeria Jimenez", "Chang Jae Choi", "Charles Ansong", "Richard Dannebaum", "Lisa Sudek", "David S.

Microorganisms have traditionally been thought to accomplish this increase by producing more ribosomes to enhance protein synthesis capacity, leading to the linear relationship between ribosome level and growth rate observed under most growth conditions previously examined. Past studies have suggested that this linear relationship represents an optimal resource allocation strategy for each growth rate, independent of any specific nutrient state. Here we investigate protein production strategies in continuous cultures limited for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, which differentially impact substrate supply for protein versus nucleic acid metabolism. Unexpectedly, we find that at slow growth rates, Escherichia coli achieves the same protein production rate using three different strategies under the three different nutrient limitations. Under phosphorus (P) limitation, translation is slow due to a particularly low abundance of ribosomes, which are RNA-rich and thus particularly costly for phosphorous-limited cells. Under nitrogen (N) limitation, translation elongation is slowed by processes including ribosome stalling at glutamine codons. Under carbon (C) limitation, translation is slowed by accumulation of inactive ribosomes not bound to messenger RNA. These extra ribosomes enable rapid growth acceleration during nutrient upshift. Thus, bacteria tune ribosome usage across different limiting nutrients to enable balanced nutrient-limited growth while also preparing for future nutrient upshifts.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0199-2", "authors": ["Sophia Hsin-Jung Li", "Zhiyuan Li", "Junyoung O.

High-temperature-adapted isolates significantly improved their fitness but also increased biofilm formation at the air–liquid interface. Furthermore, this altered lifestyle was coupled with genomic changes linked to biofilm formation in individual isolates, and was also dominant in evolved populations. We hypothesize that the increasing biofilm formation was driven by lower oxygen availability at elevated temperature, and we observe a relative fitness increase at lower oxygen.

What function does it perform? Such questions are difficult to unequivocally address and remain hotly debated. This is partially because scientists often use different philosophical definitions of ‘function’ ambiguously and interchangeably, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. Here, I argue that research studying host-associated microbial communities and their genomes (that is, microbiomes) faces similar pitfalls and that unclear or misapplied conceptions of function underpin many controversies in this field. In particular, experiments that support phenomenological models of function can inappropriately be used to support functional models that instead require specific measurements of evolutionary selection. Microbiome research also requires uniquely clear definitions of ‘who the function is for’, in contrast to most single-organism systems where this is implicit. I illustrate how obscuring either of these issues can lead to substantial confusion and misinterpretation of microbiome function, using the varied conceptions of the holobiont as a current and cogent example.

Here, we discover that IcsB is an 18-carbon fatty acyltransferase catalysing lysine Nε-fatty acylation. IcsB disrupted the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotes, resulting from Nε-fatty acylation of RhoGTPases on lysine residues in their polybasic region. Chemical proteomic profiling identified about 60 additional targets modified by IcsB during infection, which were validated by biochemical assays. Most IcsB targets are membrane-associated proteins bearing a lysine-rich polybasic region, including members of the Ras, Rho and Rab families of small GTPases. IcsB also modifies SNARE proteins and other non-GTPase substrates, suggesting an extensive interplay between S. flexneri and host membrane trafficking. IcsB is localized on the Shigella-containing vacuole to fatty-acylate its targets. Knockout of CHMP5—one of the IcsB targets and a component of the ESCRT-III complex—specifically affected S. flexneri escape from host autophagy.

Here we show that the ‘antibacterial’ T6SS of Serratia marcescens can act against fungal cells, including pathogenic Candida species, and identify the previously undescribed effector proteins responsible. These antifungal effectors, Tfe1 and Tfe2, have distinct impacts on the target cell, but both can ultimately cause fungal cell death. ‘In competition’ proteomics analysis revealed that T6SS-mediated delivery of Tfe2 disrupts nutrient uptake and amino acid metabolism in fungal cells, and leads to the induction of autophagy.

Such inference is potentially both powerful and useful for tracking the epidemiology of HIV and the allocation of resources to prevention campaigns. We recently used simulation and a small number of illustrative cases to show that certain phylogenetic patterns are associated with different types of epidemiological linkage5. Our original approach was later generalized for large next-generation sequencing datasets and implemented as a free computational pipeline6. Previous work has claimed that direction and directness of transmission could not be established from phylogeny because one could not be sure that there were no intervening or missing links involved7,8,9. Here, we address this issue by investigating phylogenetic patterns from 272 previously identified HIV transmission chains with 955 transmission pairs representing diverse geography, risk groups, subtypes, and genomic regions. These HIV transmissions had known linkage based on epidemiological information such as partner studies, mother-to-child transmission, pairs identified by contact tracing, and criminal cases. We show that the resulting phylogeny inferred from real HIV genetic sequences indeed reveals distinct patterns associated with direct transmission contra transmissions from a common source. Thus, our results establish how to interpret phylogenetic trees based on HIV sequences when tracking who-infected-whom, when and how genetic information can be used for improved tracking of HIV spread.

Considering this question is important given that scientists (who are perhaps likely to be more environmentally aware than average) may invite accusations of hypocrisy by enlarging their carbon footprint undertaking expensive journeys to attend a meeting halfway around the world. So why do we still do it? Certainly a conference gets us out of the laboratory and away from our desk/bench, providing a refreshing change of scenery. Furthermore, conferences are often held in interesting or exotic places that are desirable to visit. Yet, more than just being an excuse for a jolly, conferences provide a chance to interact in person with others in the field, talk with delegates about data presented, share gossip about the field, discuss new technologies, new papers and funding opportunities, and much more. Yes, all of this communication could be electronic, but much of the quality of such interactions is lost online. With character limits, buffering and response delays, spontaneity, personality and nuance can be absent as compared to a face-to-face interaction between a group of researchers, or between a speaker and a live audience. The importance of conference attendance has thus not waned with technological advances. Rather, being at an event in person enables community building, and helps us to process our own thinking and understanding of the ‘geography’ of the field, which is essential when it comes to strategic planning for future experiments or career choices.If attendance at conferences is still necessary then, to minimize any guilt arising from the fuel and finances burned to get there, travelling researchers should aim to squeeze every last drop of opportunity from an event. The first task is to determine the key reasons why attending a conference is being considered in the first place. This will vary from individual to individual, the specifics of their current role and career stage, as well as future plans. Early career researchers may be using a conference to obtain a broader overview of the research being carried out in their field or sub-field, and they may also be looking to make connections that will help them plot a future step in their career. Those more established may be looking to recruit lab members or entice potential faculty to joining their institution. All are likely to be looking for an opportunity to share their work, whether as a speaker or a poster presenter, and hear about the latest work from colleagues in the field.The next step is to look for a suitable conference in the calendar that matches with the aims to be realized. Is it a large or small meeting? Each comes with benefits and drawbacks; large meetings can often cover more ground scientifically but tend to be quite impersonal, whereas smaller meetings, while more limited in scope, will give a deeper view and are likely to provide plenty of opportunity for interaction with others. Are the key people in the field going to be attending? Does the conference provide a diverse line-up of speakers that is inclusive of views and topics from all different corners of the field and that is more likely to create a thought-provoking meeting? Is there an opportunity for submitting an abstract for a poster or to speak? How much will the trip cost and are bursaries available? Are there any other professional opportunities that can be added on to the trip, such as visiting local institutions and meeting collaborators? Equally important to ask is whether this is a trip that is likely to be repeated again, and if not, is it possible to take some personal time to experience the local culture? Does the conference fit with a well-balanced work and home life and would it be possible take a partner/family; are there childcare facilities provided or interesting activities to keep loved ones occupied in the vicinity?When a conference has been settled on, there is still much more that can be done to squeeze every last drop of as-yet unrealized opportunity out of the meeting. An attendee could look at who is speaking to identify anyone known or with whom making contact would be useful. This can be intimidating, especially for junior researchers, but reaching out in advance to request a short meeting at the conference is more effective than just hoping to bump into someone. Although there will be exceptions in every field of research, the overwhelming majority of researchers are nice people, who enjoy making new contacts. Go through the conference programme and work out which talks have to be seen, and which would be nice to see. If the conference has parallel sessions, check the map of the venue to make sure that moving between two talks is realistic if jumping between sessions.Once at the conference, make sure to take notes. There is a lot going on, even at smaller meetings, and the days will be long. Without notes, some of the useful information that comes up will be forgotten. During talks and interactions with other delegates, join in the discussion and make sure to ask questions. This can be intimidating, especially in a packed lecture hall, but if you have a particular question it will likely be shared by others in the audience, so raising it can help to make a speaker’s data and thinking clearer for all. Alternatively, saving the question to ask of a speaker at the end of a session can be a great way to make contact. Check if the meeting is concurrently happening on Twitter, follow the conference hashtag and use it to make acquaintances with people offline. Learn people’s names, repeat and remember, exchange contact details, Twitter handles and business cards. Social gatherings can be a good opportunity to make new contacts and cement existing ones, but keep things professional, behave responsibly around others; drink socially but not excessively, dance if the occasion calls for it, but not if it doesn’t. Take the opportunity to sleep well; attendees get more out of each day at a meeting if they are well-rested each night. When the formal conference ends, for the contacts made to be solidified, it is good practice to follow up with a quick message when back in the lab. Finally, edit and order any notes that you have taken while they are fresh in your mind, share them with colleagues in the lab that did not attend the meeting and file them in a way that you will be able to find them easily.Scientific conferences can be pivotal events in a research career; being proactive and adopting a strategy when selecting and attending will help to make the most of a meeting.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0158-y", "authors": "", "_if": "", "issn": "2058-5276"},

{"title": "CRISPR still needs microbiologists", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0175-x", "source": "Nature Microbiology 2018 3:6", "pub_date": "2018-05-24", "abstract": "There is no denying CRISPR’s rise to fame, with the topic now being featured not only on science news portals, but also in mainstream media outlets on an almost weekly basis. CRISPR has even appeared as a critical plot component of recent Hollywood blockbusters such as Rampage, where exposure to the genome-editing agent is responsible for the mutations behind the emergence of city-destroying giant wolves, crocodiles and apes. In light of such widespread exposure, the general public is now growing more cognisant of the huge potential of the technology for genome editing, the ethical debates revolving around the possible use of CRISPR to modify germline cells, and the ongoing legal disputes regarding patents. Yet, most people are probably still unaware of what the acronym actually stands for (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), that genome editing does not really require the CRISPR repeats but rather relies mostly on the use of CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins (such as Cas9), or that the history behind these discoveries is intimately linked to the study of the interactions of bacteria and archaea with the viruses that infect them.CRISPR–Cas tools are by no means the first to emerge from this area of microbiology. The study of phages and their targets has contributed uniquely to the development of molecular biology, helping to demonstrate that genes are made of DNA; leading to the discovery of restriction enzymes and other essential tools that paved the way for molecular cloning and genome sequencing (including T4 DNA ligase); and more recently revealing the existence of CRISPR–Cas systems1. This history perfectly illustrates how the study of basic microbiological processes can widely impact other fields and highlights the importance of curiosity and serendipity — as most of these studies did not set out to find new molecular tools — as the foundations for the development of applications with potential to revolutionize human activities, from agriculture to medicine. Basic research efforts by microbiologists worldwide were essential not only to discover these systems, but also to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which they operate and to adapt molecules originally involved in microbial defence against invaders into broadly used tools that work in other organisms.In light of the explosion of CRISPR–Cas papers published over the last decade, it would be easy to think that we now have a complete understanding of exactly how they function, yet many different aspects of their workings are still unclear. For example, the vast majority of CRISPR spacers found in bacteria and archaeal genomes are still of unknown origin, it’s unclear why many microorganisms don’t encode any CRISPR–Cas genes, and the evolutionary origins of these systems remain enigmatic. Furthermore, although functions beyond serving as adaptive immune systems in microorganisms have been postulated2 and a few demonstrated3, such new roles in bacteria and archaea physiology, and in modulating the composition of complex microbial communities and their ecological roles, have so far remained largely unexplored. In addition, given the incredible diversity of CRISPR–Cas systems (including 2 different classes, 5 types and at least 16 subtypes)4, coupled with continuous efforts to characterize even more microbial genomes that keep revealing new systems and variations5, there is ample ground to now interrogate what these CRISPR systems do and how they do it, particularly in their native organisms. Such studies are not only important to further our understanding of the basic biology behind CRISPR–Cas, but also have the potential to reveal new molecules with improved features and that could expand the arsenal of CRISPR-based tools and applications. The study of related systems, such as viral-encoded proteins that inactivate CRISPR–Cas systems (termed anti-CRISPRs), also presents a similar setting in which furthering our understanding of fascinating biological processes can be coupled to the discovery of new reagents with potentially disruptive applications, including by identifying proteins that could be used to regulate the activity of Cas9 and other genome-editing enzymes6.The continued study of prokaryotic mechanisms of defence against invaders has revealed even more ways through which bacteria and archaea fight their viruses that could, in the future, also be explored for yet-unpredictable uses. Such systems include BREX (bacteriophage exclusion)7, DISARM (defence island system associated with restriction–modification)8 and any of the recently identified anti-phage defence islands named after protective deities derived from various mythologies9, although these are almost certainly just the ‘tip of the iceberg’ given the vast uncharacterized genomic space in the unsequenced microbial majority.However, the road from basic discovery to biotechnological blockbuster isn’t easy to plan, design or construct, and it will require at least two key ingredients: people and financing. Microbiologists have and will certainly continue to play a crucial role in the process, particularly those doing basic research including phage and archaea virus discovery; genome discovery and analyses to identify and characterize existing and novel systems; and cellular and molecular biology aimed at deciphering the mechanisms and functions of these systems. These are vast areas of research built on the shoulders of many individuals whose praise is often forgotten, but the work of such unsung heroes is paramount for the accolades garnered by the few (https://go.nature.com/2ryVfC3). Financially, this also means that stable funding is required to support the base of the pyramid of discovery, so that new applications emerge at its tip. One interesting possibility is that whichever academic institutions end up winning the ongoing legal disputes over CRISPR patents could reinvest a significant proportion of the profits from licensing deals into basic discovery efforts, to further discovery of what could be the ‘next CRISPR’, and to support the training and careers of the next generation of microbiologists.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0175-x", "authors": "", "_if": "", "issn": "2058-5276"},

Taken at face value, this question may seem to have a straightforward answer. Falkow was a true leading light whose research and thinking have been fundamental in sculpting much of the modern microbiology field. Indeed, as very well described by Manuel Amieva in his recent piece for Nature (Nature 558, 190; 2018), Falkow’s work in isolating and characterizing plasmids and the genes that they carried, on the nature of virulence factors and pathogenesis and the development of his ‘molecular Koch’s postulates’, were foundational. Falkow also trained and inspired several generations of microbiologists who, together with Falkow, have established the field of molecular microbiology and greatly advanced our understanding of microbial pathogenesis over the course of the last half century. In short, if anyone deserves to make the cut for an obituary in our journal, surely Falkow would automatically qualify.And yet, while the case for publishing a tribute to Falkow is clear, this particular conversation never simply rests at such a neat conclusion. For any publication, whether daily, weekly or monthly, assessing the career contributions of an individual and deciding whether to commission an obituary is a task of Escheresque complexity that is fraught with pitfalls and potential for political missteps. The main problem lies in defining criteria by which to decide to cover one individual and not another, and how these criteria can fairly be applied across a diverse field. How many ground-breaking discoveries does a researcher need to develop to reach the pass mark, an entire career’s worth or can just one idea so daring and new that it leaves an indelible mark on the field be sufficient? Can a career spent making incremental but ultimately important steps count just as much? Does the microbiologist in question need to have trained and led others not just to follow in their footsteps, but to carve out new paths of their own, or is it sufficient to have focused solely on advancing their own research programme? Researchers rarely (if ever these days) work in isolation, and so one of the problems that afflicts the awarding of prizes such as the Nobel’s also applies to obituaries; how to disentangle the contributions of collaborative efforts when deciding if an obituary is appropriate for one member of a team.In addition to such scientific considerations, we also found ourselves asking whether by publishing obituaries we would, intentionally or not, find that we were paying tribute only to those individuals that had already received plaudits widely during their careers. In light of their efforts, such researchers may well have benefitted handsomely in terms of appointments at prestigious institutions, generous funding of their research over many decades and awards accrued. There will be many whose career achievements could justifiably have been judged as equal but for whom the limelight and wider acknowledgement of their efforts never materialized. Compounding this, obituaries will often (although by no means always) be considered 20 or 30 years after a researcher has retired, meaning that those who did not achieve a certain level of recognition during the active part of their career, or leave behind a field of trainees to carry a torch for their work, may be unfairly overlooked. Perhaps even more seriously, aside from those that pass away in their relative scientific youth, obituaries published now reflect the make-up of our field as it was 20–50 years ago. Consequently, while there are obituary-worthy microbiologists who also happen to be women and/or from under-represented minorities, the list of potential candidates is overall quite limited in its diversity and we risk paying tribute mainly to the often well-celebrated white men that dominated scientific faculties of the era.Finally, there is the politically sensitive task of deciding who to approach to write an obituary. Certainly they need to have detailed knowledge of the individual in question, and this often means approaching friends, colleagues and collaborators (and sometimes even competitors) of the researcher in question. Yet, ensuring that an obituary is accurate and a fair description of the main contributions of their life and work can be challenging, especially outside of the strict scientific record where the use of anecdote and personal reflection is necessary to provide depth but can risk portraying the subject in the authors chosen light, which may be at odds with the experience of others.As with the previous occurrences, our latest conversation on obituaries concluded with a decision not to include them as a content type published in Nature Microbiology, although we acknowledge that they can serve an important purpose in recognizing contributions to scientific fields (and understand how other journals considering these questions have come to different conclusions). However, out of these discussions grew an idea that we hope will address some of the issues described above. Using the platform provided by the Nature Research Microbiology Community, we have created a channel for what we are going to call ‘Microbiographies’ (https://go.nature.com/2sWx818) that will provide a place for people to post recollections, anecdotes and thoughts on those people that have influenced their career. This need not be limited to posting only obituaries following a death, indeed we encourage the use of this channel to celebrate the contributions of any microbiologists that the author thinks suitable for praise, irrespective of whether they work at a prestigious institution or are lauded widely for their work. Is a microbiologist from your field or department retiring or moving? Perhaps post a microbiography to mark the occasion. We also hope to read stories of community member’s personal heroes and those that have helped them along on their careers, no matter whether it was a giant shove or a little nudge. Importantly, the community is free to read and anyone can join and post to it, and so while we will from time to time be inviting microbiographies on particular individuals, the channel will be a democratizing space in which we hope to enable the field to celebrate microbiologists no matter the scale of attention that their contribution has previously garnered.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0193-8", "authors": "", "_if": "", "issn": "2058-5276"},

{"title": "Deliver on diagnostics to save lives", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0220-9", "source": "Nature Microbiology 2018 3:8", "pub_date": "2018-07-25", "abstract": "The adage ‘an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure’, when applied to infectious disease, highlights that more attention could be paid to developing vaccines than discovering antimicrobials. Yet this leaves out a key step entirely — that of diagnostics. For example, tests that discriminate between infectious agents help clinicians select appropriate treatment, start effective therapy earlier and avoid drug overuse, which could select for resistance.Highlighting the late recognition of diagnostics as a critical axis, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently released its first Essential Diagnostics List (EDL; https://go.nature.com/2ztcF9P), four decades after the first Essential Medicines List (EML). The EDL assesses which diagnostic tests should be readily available at various levels of health care systems; and countries should use the EDL as a starting point to curate their own diagnostic lists based on disease priorities and local factors. It is striking that 55 of the 113 tests highlighted specifically diagnose and quantify disease severity against a suite of ‘priority’ infectious diseases caused by viruses (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) and human papilloma virus), bacteria (tuberculosis (TB) and syphilis) and parasites (malaria and Cryptococcus), which collectively infect over 800 million and kill nearly 5 million individuals per year.Many of these infectious disease diagnostics have been made possible due to better characterization of specific molecular markers for disease, and technological advances enabling their rapid detection with high sensitivity and in formats that do not require expensive equipment. For example, many of the rapid tests on the EDL are immunoassay-based tests that detect microbial antigens or pathogen-specific antibodies in blood, which saves significant time compared to culturing approaches, a critical bottleneck for treating patients with severe disease.The EDL also shows that while immunoassays are attractive, sequence-based approaches (currently recommended for settings with clinical laboratories) can report on additional clinical parameters beyond pathogen presence. For example, nucleic-acid tests against several viruses (HIV, HBV, HCV) can provide quantitative information on pathogen burden and treatment efficacy, while tests targeting specific regions of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome can simultaneously report on TB infection and the presence of key drug resistance mutations.The release of the EDL is to be celebrated, as it provides much needed exposure for the diagnostics field and encourages countries to adopt new tests to improve treatment outcomes. The WHO EML (https://go.nature.com/2uvWxPd) helped countries prioritize and push for the use of the most useful drugs for their citizens. For example, the addition of HIV anti-retrovirals to the list in 2002 very likely contributed to the political push to make these life-saving drugs more affordable (and thus accessible) to populations in need (https://go.nature.com/2u7D6g7). It is to be hoped that the EDL may similarly increase access to diagnostics.Some limitations remain for the practical use of diagnostic tests across different clinical settings, especially in resource-limited point-of-care contexts. Addressing these challenges will require a balancing act between diagnostic accuracy, clinical impact and cost. For example, there is promise in using mass spectrometry and whole genome sequencing to identify pathogens and markers of drug resistance, but questions of sensitivity and specificity remain. These methods also typically require expensive equipment and technical training that is hard to access outside well-staffed reference laboratories. Approaches to diagnose disease directly from clinical samples other than blood (such as urine and faeces) will also prove of clinical relevance, as these are more accessible patient samples. Further research will also be required to either adapt existing tests or develop new approaches for emerging (and resistant) pathogens, including fungi.Beyond scientific challenges, attention is also needed to address implementation barriers. For example, as with medicines, quality assurance and stable supply chains are critical for appropriate use of diagnostics, especially in under-resourced settings. As testing may be performed in the field, technologies to improve how data are communicated between local and national clinics will be important for real-time diagnosis and may provide avenues to incorporate the data into larger surveillance programmes that can detect emerging epidemics or inform antimicrobial stewardship efforts. Also, logistical and economic concerns remain as to how these tests can be integrated into public health programmes alongside existing tests, and how already stretched public health budgets can accommodate their cost. It is clear that political commitments are needed to expand funding to clinical laboratories at both at national and local levels, and to guarantee that tests are available to those who need them. Over the long term, by limiting the scope of treatment needed and helping halt outbreaks, implementing effective diagnostics may end up being cost neutral or save healthcare systems money.While current diagnostics are rapidly changing the face of infectious disease treatment, much work remains to develop a suite of broadly useful tests to identify pathogens, their drug susceptibilities and inform personalized clinical decision-making. At Nature Microbiology we are invested in publishing advances in diagnostics-related research, whether it be new methods and devices that significantly reduce time to diagnosis; improve the sensitivity and specificity of pathogen identification (including new pathogens associated with outbreaks); enable better direct testing from clinical samples; or produce more accurate drug susceptibility prediction compared to current culture-based approaches.The WHO EDL is an important step to better publicize the role of diagnostics in infectious disease treatment, but successful future use of diagnostics will require solid commitments to develop new tests, guarantee accurate diagnostics and to ensure that tests are accessible, affordable and used appropriately.", "doi": "10.1038/s41564-018-0220-9", "authors": "", "_if": "", "issn": "2058-5276"},

To understand the resistance mechanisms, we conducted whole-genome CRISPR–Cas9 synthetic-viability/resistance screens in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells treated with PARP inhibitors. We identified two previously uncharacterized proteins, C20orf196 and FAM35A, whose inactivation confers strong PARP-inhibitor resistance. Mechanistically, we show that C20orf196 and FAM35A form a complex, ‘Shieldin’ (SHLD1/2), with FAM35A interacting with single-stranded DNA through its C-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold region. We establish that Shieldin acts as the downstream effector of 53BP1/RIF1/MAD2L2 to promote DNA double-strand break (DSB) end-joining by restricting DSB resection and to counteract homologous recombination by antagonizing BRCA2/RAD51 loading in BRCA1-deficient cells. Notably, Shieldin inactivation further sensitizes BRCA1-deficient cells to cisplatin, suggesting how defining the SHLD1/2 status of BRCA1-deficient tumours might aid patient stratification and yield new treatment opportunities.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the major uptake pathway in resting cells1, but several clathrin-independent endocytic routes exist in parallel2,3. One such pathway, fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis (FEME), is not constitutive but triggered upon activation of certain receptors, including the β1 adrenergic receptor4. FEME activates promptly following stimulation as endophilin is pre-enriched by the phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate-binding protein lamellipodin4,5. However, in the absence of stimulation, endophilin foci abort and disassemble after a few seconds. Looking for additional proteins involved in FEME, we found that 20 out of 65 BAR domain-containing proteins tested colocalized with endophilin spots. Among them, FBP17 and CIP4 prime the membrane of resting cells for FEME by recruiting the 5′-lipid phosphatase SHIP2 and lamellipodin to mediate the local production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate and endophilin pre-enrichment. Membrane-bound GTP-loaded Cdc42 recruits FBP17 and CIP4, before being locally deactivated by RICH1 and SH3BP1 GTPase-activating proteins. This generates the transient assembly and disassembly of endophilin spots, which lasts 5–10 seconds.

Denervation-activated FAPs exhibited persistent STAT3 activation and secreted elevated levels of IL-6, which promoted muscle atrophy and fibrosis.

Here we perform single-cell profiling of human bronchial epithelial cells and mouse tracheal epithelial cells to obtain a comprehensive census of cell types in the conducting airway and their behaviour in homeostasis and regeneration. Our analysis reveals cell states that represent known and novel cell populations, delineates their heterogeneity and identifies distinct differentiation trajectories during homeostasis and tissue repair.

Ionic diffusion within the electrochemically active particles generally represents a fundamental limitation to the rate at which a battery can be charged and discharged. To compensate for the relatively slow solid-state ionic diffusion and to enable high power and rapid charging, the active particles are frequently reduced to nanometre dimensions, to the detriment of volumetric packing density, cost, stability and sustainability. As an alternative to nanoscaling, here we show that two complex niobium tungsten oxides—Nb16W5O55 and Nb18W16O93, which adopt crystallographic shear and bronze-like structures, respectively—can intercalate large quantities of lithium at high rates, even when the sizes of the niobium tungsten oxide particles are of the order of micrometres. Measurements of lithium-ion diffusion coefficients in both structures reveal room-temperature values that are several orders of magnitude higher than those in typical electrode materials such as Li4Ti5O12 and LiMn2O4. Multielectron redox, buffered volume expansion, topologically frustrated niobium/tungsten polyhedral arrangements and rapid solid-state lithium transport lead to extremely high volumetric capacities and rate performance.

One human chromosome is a fusion product of the ancestral state6. This raises the question: how well can species tolerate a change in chromosome numbers without substantial changes to genome content? Many tools are used in chromosome engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae7,8,9,10, but CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome editing facilitates the most aggressive engineering strategies. Here we successfully fused yeast chromosomes using CRISPR–Cas9, generating a near-isogenic series of strains with progressively fewer chromosomes ranging from sixteen to two. A strain carrying only two chromosomes of about six megabases each exhibited modest transcriptomic changes and grew without major defects. When we crossed a sixteen-chromosome strain with strains with fewer chromosomes, we noted two trends. As the number of chromosomes dropped below sixteen, spore viability decreased markedly, reaching less than 10% for twelve chromosomes. As the number of chromosomes decreased further, yeast sporulation was arrested: a cross between a sixteen-chromosome strain and an eight-chromosome strain showed greatly reduced full tetrad formation and less than 1% sporulation, from which no viable spores could be recovered. However, homotypic crosses between pairs of strains with eight, four or two chromosomes produced excellent sporulation and spore viability. These results indicate that eight chromosome–chromosome fusion events suffice to isolate strains reproductively. Overall, budding yeast tolerates a reduction in chromosome number unexpectedly well, providing a striking example of the robustness of genomes to change.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-018-0374-x", "authors": ["Jingchuan Luo", "Xiaoji Sun", "Brendan P.

Among the genes coding for the MYST family of KATs (KAT5–KAT8) are the oncogenes KAT6A (also known as MOZ) and KAT6B (also known as MORF and QKF)2,3. KAT6A has essential roles in normal haematopoietic stem cells4,5,6 and is the target of recurrent chromosomal translocations, causing acute myeloid leukaemia7,8. Similarly, chromosomal translocations in KAT6B have been identified in diverse cancers8. KAT6A suppresses cellular senescence through the regulation of suppressors of the CDKN2A locus9,10, a function that requires its KAT activity10. Loss of one allele of KAT6A extends the median survival of mice with MYC-induced lymphoma from 105 to 413 days11. These findings suggest that inhibition of KAT6A and KAT6B may provide a therapeutic benefit in cancer. Here we present highly potent, selective inhibitors of KAT6A and KAT6B, denoted WM-8014 and WM-1119. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that these compounds are reversible competitors of acetyl coenzyme A and inhibit MYST-catalysed histone acetylation. WM-8014 and WM-1119 induce cell cycle exit and cellular senescence without causing DNA damage. Senescence is INK4A/ARF-dependent and is accompanied by changes in gene expression that are typical of loss of KAT6A function. WM-8014 potentiates oncogene-induced senescence in vitro and in a zebrafish model of hepatocellular carcinoma. WM-1119, which has increased bioavailability, arrests the progression of lymphoma in mice.

The conspicuous existence of blue boron-bearing diamonds (type IIb)8,9 reveals that boron, an element abundant in the continental and oceanic crust, is present in certain diamond-forming fluids at mantle depths. However, both the provenance of the boron and the geological setting of diamond crystallization were unknown. Here we show that boron-bearing diamonds carry previously unrecognized mineral assemblages whose high-pressure precursors were stable in metamorphosed oceanic lithospheric slabs at depths reaching the lower mantle. We propose that some of the boron in seawater-serpentinized oceanic lithosphere is subducted into the deep mantle, where it is released with hydrous fluids that enable diamond growth10.

Discrimination is the ability to tell two stimuli apart (for example, whether one can tell apart colours close to each other in hue). Categorization concerns whether stimuli are grouped based on similarities (for example, identifying colours with qualitative similarities in hue as similar even if they can be distinguished)4. Categorical perception is a mechanism by which perceptual systems categorize continuously varying stimuli, making specific predictions about discrimination relative to category boundaries. Here we show that female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) categorically perceive a continuously variable assessment signal: the orange to red spectrum of male beak colour. Both predictions of categorical perception5 were supported: females (1) categorized colour stimuli that varied along a continuum and (2) showed increased discrimination between colours from opposite sides of a category boundary compared to equally different colours from within a category.

Upon completion of assembly and budding, proteolytic cleavage of Gag leads to virus maturation, in which the immature lattice is broken down; the liberated CA domain of Gag then re-assembles into the mature conical capsid that encloses the viral genome and associated enzymes. Folding and proteolysis of the six-helix bundle are crucial rate-limiting steps of both Gag assembly and disassembly, and the six-helix bundle is an established target of HIV-1 inhibitors4,5. Here, using a combination of structural and functional analyses, we show that inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6, also known as IP6) facilitates the formation of the six-helix bundle and assembly of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. IP6 makes ionic contacts with two rings of lysine residues at the centre of the Gag hexamer. Proteolytic cleavage then unmasks an alternative binding site, where IP6 interaction promotes the assembly of the mature capsid lattice.

Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-018-0386-6", "authors": ["Mohammad Bahram", "Falk Hildebrand", "Sofia K.

Although the use of native functional groups (for example, carboxylic acids, alkenes and alcohols) has improved the overall efficiency of such transformations by expanding the range of potential feedstocks3,4,5, the direct functionalization of carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bonds—the most abundant moiety in organic molecules—represents a more ideal approach to molecular construction. In recent years, an impressive range of reactions that form C(sp3)–heteroatom bonds from strong C–H bonds has been reported6,7. Additionally, valuable technologies have been developed for the formation of carbon–carbon bonds from the corresponding C(sp3)–H bonds via substrate-directed transition-metal C–H insertion8, undirected C–H insertion by captodative rhodium carbenoid complexes9, or hydrogen atom transfer from weak, hydridic C–H bonds by electrophilic open-shell species10,11,12,13,14. Despite these advances, a mild and general platform for the coupling of strong, neutral C(sp3)–H bonds with aryl electrophiles has not been realized. Here we describe a protocol for the direct C(sp3) arylation of a diverse set of aliphatic, C–H bond-containing organic frameworks through the combination of light-driven, polyoxometalate-facilitated hydrogen atom transfer and nickel catalysis. This dual-catalytic manifold enables the generation of carbon-centred radicals from strong, neutral C–H bonds, which thereafter act as nucleophiles in nickel-mediated cross-coupling with aryl bromides to afford C(sp3)–C(sp2) cross-coupled products.

These two fundamental interfacial wave phenomena form the basis of fabricating various wave components, such as optical lenses. Classical refraction—now referred to as positive refraction—causes the transmitted wave to appear on the opposite side of the interface normal compared to the incident wave. By contrast, negative refraction results in the transmitted wave emerging on the same side of the interface normal. It has been observed in artificial materials1,2,3,4,5, following its theoretical prediction6, and has stimulated many applications including super-resolution imaging7. In general, reflection is inevitable during the refraction process, but this is often undesirable in designing wave functional devices. Here we report negative refraction of topological surface waves hosted by a Weyl phononic crystal—an acoustic analogue of the recently discovered Weyl semimetals8,9,10,11,12. The interfaces at which this topological negative refraction occurs are one-dimensional edges separating different facets of the crystal. By tailoring the surface terminations of the Weyl phononic crystal, constant-frequency contours of surface acoustic waves can be designed to produce negative refraction at certain interfaces, while positive refraction is realized at different interfaces within the same sample. In contrast to the more familiar behaviour of waves at interfaces, unwanted reflection can be prevented in our crystal, owing to the open nature of the constant-frequency contours, which is a hallmark of the topologically protected  surface states in Weyl crystals8,9,10,11,12.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-018-0367-9", "authors": ["Hailong He", "Chunyin Qiu", "Liping Ye", "Xiangxi Cai", "Xiying Fan", "Manzhu Ke", "Fan Zhang", "Zhengyou Liu"], "_if": "", "issn": "1476-4687"},

It is thought that the evolution of this atmospheric carbon dioxide (and that of atmospheric methane) during the glacial-to-interglacial transition was influenced by organic carbon that was stored in permafrost during the LGM and then underwent decomposition and release following thaw2,3. It has also been suggested that the rather erratic atmospheric δ13C and ∆14C signals seen during deglaciation1,4 could partly be explained by the presence of a large terrestrial inert LGM carbon stock, despite the biosphere being less productive (and therefore storing less carbon)5,6. Here we present an empirically derived estimate of the carbon stored in permafrost during the LGM by reconstructing the extent and carbon content of LGM biomes, peatland regions and deep sedimentary deposits. We find that the total estimated soil carbon stock for the LGM northern permafrost region is smaller than the estimated present-day storage (in both permafrost and non-permafrost soils) for the same region. A substantial decrease in the permafrost area from the LGM to the present day has been accompanied by a roughly 400-petagram increase in the total soil carbon stock. This increase in soil carbon suggests that permafrost carbon has made no net contribution to the atmospheric carbon pool since the LGM. However, our results also indicate potential postglacial reductions in the portion of the carbon stock that is trapped in permafrost, of around 1,000 petagrams, supporting earlier studies7. We further find that carbon has shifted from being primarily stored in permafrost mineral soils and loess deposits during the LGM, to being roughly equally divided between peatlands, mineral soils and permafrost loess deposits today.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-018-0371-0", "authors": ["Amelie Lindgren", "Gustaf Hugelius", "Peter Kuhry"], "_if": "", "issn": "1476-4687"},

We characterize the coupling between these orders by measuring the composite order parameter and the elementary excitations and explain our results with a mean-field free-energy model derived from a microscopic Hamiltonian.

Here we show that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a molecular switch that when active, stimulates muscle fibers to grow, resulting in increased muscle mass. Conversely, when muscle JNK activation is suppressed, an alternative remodeling program is initiated, resulting in smaller, more oxidative muscle fibers, and enhanced aerobic fitness. When muscle is exposed to mechanical stress, JNK initiates muscle growth via phosphorylation of the transcription factor, SMAD2, at specific linker region residues leading to inhibition of the growth suppressor, myostatin. In human skeletal muscle, this JNK/SMAD signaling axis is activated by resistance exercise, but not endurance exercise.

Our results indicate that the local palaeoclimate was teleconnected strongly to the overall global cooling pattern, so that local enhanced aridification recorded by the studied aeolian sequence is dominantly a response to global climatic forcing rather than plateau uplift.", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-05415-x", "authors": ["J.

CO2 was strongly adsorbed onto ruthenium surface, forming hybrid orbitals. The band gap energy was reduced significantly upon hybridization, enhancing CO2 dissociation.

Geometrically, the HHG signal is sensitive to spatial orientations of monolayers.

The on–off methodology employed is based on the control of the intersystem crossing (ISC) process. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the nitrophenyl group effectively opens the nonradiative ISC channel to impart the high sensitivity and contrast On–Off behavior.

Here we use a combination of lineage tracing, gene disruption and single-cell RNA-sequencing assays to explore the properties of the lateral plate ectoderm of the proto-vertebrate, Ciona intestinalis. There are notable parallels between the patterning of the lateral plate in Ciona and the compartmentalization of the neural plate ectoderm in vertebrates4. Both systems exhibit sequential patterns of Six1/2, Pax3/7 and Msxb expression that depend on a network of interlocking regulatory interactions4. In Ciona, this compartmentalization network produces distinct but related types of sensory cells that share similarities with derivatives of both cranial placodes and the neural crest in vertebrates. Simple genetic disruptions result in the conversion of one sensory cell type into another. We focused on bipolar tail neurons, because they arise from the tail regions of the lateral plate and possess properties of the dorsal root ganglia, a derivative of the neural crest in vertebrates5. Notably, bipolar tail neurons were readily transformed into palp sensory cells, a proto-placodal sensory cell type that arises from the anterior-most regions of the lateral plate in the Ciona tadpole6. Proof of transformation was confirmed by whole-embryo single-cell RNA-sequencing assays. These findings suggest that compartmentalization of the lateral plate ectoderm preceded the advent of vertebrates, and served as a common source for the evolution of both cranial placodes and neural crest3,4.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-018-0385-7", "authors": ["Ryoko Horie", "Alex Hazbun", "Kai Chen", "Chen Cao", "Michael Levine", "Takeo Horie"], "_if": "", "issn": "1476-4687"},

Here, we combine genome editing and multi-color live imaging to simultaneously visualize physical enhancer–promoter interaction and transcription at the single-cell level in Drosophila embryos. By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even-skipped enhancers, which are located 150 kb away, we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics. We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation. Transcription in turn affects the three-dimensional topology as it enhances the temporal stability of the proximal conformation and is associated with further spatial compaction. Furthermore, the facilitated long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Our approach offers quantitative insight into the spatial and temporal determinants of long-range gene regulation and their implications for cellular fates.", "doi": "10.1038/s41588-018-0175-z", "authors": ["Hongtao Chen", "Michal Levo", "Lev Barinov", "Miki Fujioka", "James B.

The global soil-to-atmosphere (or total soil respiration, RS) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux is increasing3,4, but the degree to which climate change will stimulate carbon losses from soils as a result of heterotrophic respiration (RH) remains highly uncertain5,6,7,8. Here we use an updated global soil respiration database9 to show that the observed soil surface RH:RS ratio increased significantly, from 0.54 to 0.63, between 1990 and 2014 (P = 0.009). Three additional lines of evidence provide support for this finding. By analysing two separate global gross primary production datasets10,11, we find that the ratios of both RH and RS to gross primary production have increased over time. Similarly, significant increases in RH are observed against the longest available solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence global dataset, as well as gross primary production computed by an ensemble of global land models. We also show that the ratio of night-time net ecosystem exchange to gross primary production is rising across the FLUXNET201512 dataset. All trends are robust to sampling variability in ecosystem type, disturbance, methodology, CO2 fertilization effects and mean climate. Taken together, our findings provide observational evidence that global RH is rising, probably in response to environmental changes, consistent with meta-analyses13,14,15,16 and long-term experiments17. This suggests that climate-driven losses of soil carbon are currently occurring across many ecosystems, with a detectable and sustained trend emerging at the global scale.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-018-0358-x", "authors": ["Ben Bond-Lamberty", "Vanessa L.

We identify a peptide (P2C) that mediates transduction of Cas9 RNP from the female hemolymph to the developing mosquito oocytes, resulting in heritable gene editing of the offspring with efficiency as high as 0.3 mutants per injected mosquito.

CTNNA2 was expressed in human cerebral cortex, and its loss in neurons led to defects in neurite stability and migration. The αN-catenin paralog, αE-catenin, acts as a switch regulating the balance between β-catenin and Arp2/3 actin filament activities1. Loss of αN-catenin did not affect β-catenin signaling, but recombinant αN-catenin interacted with purified actin and repressed ARP2/3 actin-branching activity. The actin-binding domain of αN-catenin or ARP2/3 inhibitors rescued the neuronal phenotype associated with CTNNA2 loss, suggesting ARP2/3 de-repression as a potential disease mechanism.

We found that human Cas9-induced SSTR requires the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is normally implicated in interstrand cross-link repair. The FA pathway does not directly impact error-prone, non-homologous end joining, but instead diverts repair toward SSTR. Furthermore, FANCD2 protein localizes to Cas9-induced DSBs, indicating a direct role in regulating genome editing.

Cancer cells critically depend on stress-relief pathways for their survival. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional initiation and maintenance of the oncogenic stress response remain elusive. Here, we show that the expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and the downstream mediators of the heat shock response is transcriptionally upregulated in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Hsf1 ablation suppresses the growth of human T-ALL and eradicates leukemia in mouse models of T-ALL, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. HSF1 drives a compact transcriptional program and among the direct HSF1 targets, specific chaperones and co-chaperones mediate its critical role in T-ALL. Notably, we demonstrate that the central T-ALL oncogene NOTCH1 hijacks the cellular stress response machinery by inducing the expression of HSF1 and its downstream effectors. The NOTCH1 signaling status controls the levels of chaperone/co-chaperone complexes and predicts the response of T-ALL patient samples to HSP90 inhibition.

However, the primary molecular mechanism of this biguanide remains unclear, though it has been suggested to act, at least partially, by mitochondrial complex I inhibition. Here we show that clinically relevant concentrations of plasma metformin achieved by acute intravenous, acute intraportal or chronic oral administration in awake normal and diabetic rats inhibit gluconeogenesis from lactate and glycerol but not from pyruvate and alanine, implicating an increased cytosolic redox state in mediating metformin’s antihyperglycemic effect. All of these effects occurred independently of complex I inhibition, evidenced by unaltered hepatic energy charge and citrate synthase flux. Normalizing the cytosolic redox state by infusion of methylene blue or substrates that contribute to gluconeogenesis independently of the cytosolic redox state abrogated metformin-mediated inhibition of gluconeogenesis in vivo. Additionally, in mice expressing constitutively active acetyl-CoA carboxylase, metformin acutely decreased hepatic glucose production and increased the hepatic cytosolic redox state without altering hepatic triglyceride content or gluconeogenic enzyme expression. These studies demonstrate that metformin, at clinically relevant plasma concentrations, inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis in a redox-dependent manner independently of reductions in citrate synthase flux, hepatic nucleotide concentrations, acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, or gluconeogenic enzyme protein expression.", "doi": "10.1038/s41591-018-0125-4", "authors": ["Anila K.

Here, we performed intervention studies in which smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage-tracing Apoe-/- mice with advanced atherosclerosis were treated with anti-IL-1β or IgG control antibodies. Surprisingly, we found that IL-1β antibody treatment between 18 and 26 weeks of Western diet feeding induced a marked reduction in SMC and collagen content, but increased macrophage numbers in the fibrous cap. Moreover, although IL-1β antibody treatment had no effect on lesion size, it completely inhibited beneficial outward remodeling. We also found that SMC-specific knockout of Il1r1 (encoding IL-1 receptor type 1) resulted in smaller lesions nearly devoid of SMCs and lacking a fibrous cap, whereas macrophage-selective loss of IL-1R1 had no effect on lesion size or composition.

Dynamin, a large GTPase, mediates membrane fission by assembling around, constricting and cleaving the necks of budding vesicles1. Here we report a 3.75 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the membrane-associated helical polymer of human dynamin-1 in the GMPPCP-bound state. The structure defines the helical symmetry of the dynamin polymer and the positions of its oligomeric interfaces, which were validated by cell-based endocytosis assays. Compared to the lipid-free tetramer form2, membrane-associated dynamin binds to the lipid bilayer with its pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) and self-assembles across the helical rungs via its guanine nucleotide-binding (GTPase) domain3. Notably, interaction with the membrane and helical assembly are accommodated by a severely bent bundle signalling element (BSE), which connects the GTPase domain to the rest of the protein. The BSE conformation is asymmetric across the inter-rung GTPase interface, and is unique compared to all known nucleotide-bound states of dynamin. The structure suggests that the BSE bends as a result of forces generated from the GTPase dimer interaction that are transferred across the stalk to the PHD and lipid membrane. Mutations that disrupted the BSE kink impaired endocytosis. We also report a 10.1 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of a super-constricted dynamin polymer showing localized conformational changes at the BSE and GTPase domains, induced by GTP hydrolysis, that drive membrane constriction.

The effects of both radiotherapy and immune-checkpoint inhibition (ICI) involve a complex interplay with the innate and adaptive immune systems, and accumulating evidence suggests that, under certain circumstances, the effects of radiotherapy synergize with those of ICI to augment the antitumour responses typically observed with either modality alone and thus improve clinical outcomes. However, the mechanisms by which radiotherapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors synergistically modulate the immune response might also affect both the type and severity of treatment-related toxicities. Moreover, in patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors, the development of immune-related adverse events has been linked with superior treatment responses and patient survival durations, suggesting a relationship between the antitumour and adverse autoimmune effects of these agents.

Altered integrin expression is frequently detected in tumours, where integrins have roles in supporting oncogenic growth factor receptor (GFR) signalling and GFR-dependent cancer cell migration and invasion. In addition, integrins determine colonization of metastatic sites and facilitate anchorage-independent survival of circulating tumour cells. Investigations describing integrin engagement with a growing number of versatile cell surface molecules, including channels, receptors and secreted proteins, continue to lead to the identification of novel tumour-promoting pathways. Integrin-mediated sensing, stiffening and remodelling of the tumour stroma are key steps in cancer progression supporting invasion, acquisition of cancer stem cell characteristics and drug resistance. Given the complexity of integrins and their adaptable and sometimes antagonistic roles in cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment, therapeutic targeting of these receptors has been a challenge. However, novel approaches to target integrins and antagonism of specific integrin subunits in stringently stratified patient cohorts are emerging as potential ways forward.", "doi": "10.1038/s41568-018-0038-z", "authors": ["Hellyeh Hamidi", "Johanna Ivaska"], "_if": "", "issn": "1474-1768"},

A detailed understanding of the dynamics of evolutionary drivers is required for the rational development of curative therapies. Herein, we describe the molecular basis of the clonal evolution of urothelial carcinomas and the use of genomic approaches to predict treatment responses. We discuss various mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy with a focus on the mutagenic effects of the DNA dC->dU-editing enzymes APOBEC3 family of proteins. We also review the evolutionary mechanisms underlying resistance to immunotherapy, such as the loss of clonal tumour neoantigens.

Several immunosuppressive mechanisms operate in the milieu of most tumours, a condition that makes antitumour immunity ineffective. One of the most potent immunosuppressive factors is adenosine, which is generated in the tumour microenvironment owing to degradation of extracellular ATP. Accruing evidence over the past few years shows that ATP is one of the major biochemical constituents of the tumour microenvironment, where it acts at P2 purinergic receptors expressed on both tumour and host cells. Stimulation of P2 receptors has different effects depending on the extracellular ATP concentration, the P2 receptor subtype engaged and the target cell type. Among P2 receptors, the P2X purinergic receptor 7 (P2X7R) subtype appears to be a main player in host–tumour cell interactions. Preclinical studies in several tumour models have shown that P2X7R targeting is potentially a very effective anticancer treatment, and many pharmaceutical companies have now developed potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of P2X7R. In this Review, we report on the multiple mechanisms by which extracellular ATP shapes the tumour microenvironment and how its stimulation of host and tumour cell P2 receptors contributes to determining tumour fate.", "doi": "10.1038/s41568-018-0037-0", "authors": ["Francesco Di Virgilio", "Alba Clara Sarti", "Simonetta Falzoni", "Elena De Marchi", "Elena Adinolfi"], "_if": "", "issn": "1474-1768"},

Such communication predominantly involves the secretion of soluble factors by cancer cells and/or stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment (TME), although these cell types have also been shown to export membrane-encapsulated particles containing regulatory molecules that contribute to cell–cell communication. These particles are known as extracellular vesicles (EVs) and include species of exosomes and shed microvesicles. EVs carry molecules such as oncoproteins and oncopeptides, RNA species (for example, microRNAs, mRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs), lipids, and DNA fragments from donor to recipient cells, initiating profound phenotypic changes in the TME. Emerging evidence suggests that EVs have crucial roles in cancer development, including pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. Cancer cells are now recognized to secrete more EVs than their nonmalignant counterparts, and these particles can be isolated from bodily fluids. Thus, EVs have strong potential as blood-based or urine-based biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognostication, and surveillance of cancer.

Genomic studies have established the landscape of molecular alterations in HCC; however, the most common mutations are not actionable, and only ~25% of tumours harbour potentially targetable drivers. Despite the fact that surveillance programmes lead to early diagnosis in 40–50% of patients, at a point when potentially curative treatments are applicable, almost half of all patients with HCC ultimately receive systemic therapies. Sorafenib was the first systemic therapy approved for patients with advanced-stage HCC, after a landmark study revealed an improvement in median overall survival from 8 to 11 months. New drugs — lenvatinib in the frontline and regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab in the second line — have also been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes, although the median overall survival remains ~1 year; thus, therapeutic breakthroughs are still needed. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors are now being incorporated into the HCC treatment armamentarium and combinations of molecularly targeted therapies with immunotherapies are emerging as tools to boost the immune response.

Accordingly, novel antithrombotic therapies have been traditionally tested on a background of acetylsalicylic acid therapy. Although the adjunctive use of such antithrombotic therapies can potentially further reduce the risk of ischaemic events, these agents are also inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding. However, acetylsalicylic acid also increases the risk of bleeding, challenging the paradigm that this agent should remain the cornerstone of antiplatelet treatment when alternative antithrombotic agents are also used. Many antithrombotic compounds are characterized by increased potency and consistent efficacy, which might lessen the need for concomitant acetylsalicylic acid. Accordingly, numerous investigations are testing the hypothesis that acetylsalicylic acid-sparing regimens based on newer antithrombotic agents might have an increased net benefit for individual patients owing to the reduction in bleeding risk, without a trade-off in efficacy.

Potential mechanisms of inflammageing include genetic susceptibility, central obesity, increased gut permeability, changes to microbiota composition, cellular senescence, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, oxidative stress caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, immune cell dysregulation, and chronic infections. Inflammageing is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and clinical trials suggest that this association is causal. Inflammageing is also a risk factor for chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, depression, dementia, and sarcopenia, but whether modulating inflammation beneficially affects the clinical course of non-CVD health problems is controversial. This uncertainty is an important issue to address because older patients with CVD are often affected by multimorbidity and frailty — which affect clinical manifestations, prognosis, and response to treatment — and are associated with inflammation by mechanisms similar to those in CVD. The hypothesis that inflammation affects CVD, multimorbidity, and frailty by inhibiting growth factors, increasing catabolism, and interfering with homeostatic signalling is supported by mechanistic studies but requires confirmation in humans.

Scientists will come together to discuss many important advances, from the utilization of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived preparations to model human disease pathogenesis to the development and clinical translation of stem cell–based therapies to treat human disease. Virtually all of this work seeks to harness, in one way or another, the insights gleaned from pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) for discovery or therapeutic purposes. It is this amazing intrinsic potential of ESCs themselves, as well as the germ cell and zygotic lineages from which they derive, that has enabled remarkable achievements in the field of reproductive medicine. These advances have not only furthered our understanding of the earliest phases of mammalian development, but also enabled groundbreaking advances in assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) that have given hope to an increasing contingent of people struggling with fertility issues.In addition to offering an annual forum for the presentation and discussion of exciting scientific work, the ISSCR assumes the task of setting and communicating internationally agreed-upon guidelines for the various forms of research that utilize stem cells, including the complicated ethical considerations that must be faced when studying, culturing, or manipulating human gametes and embryos. In a recent announcement published in Nature (Nature 557, 6, 2018), the Nature Research Journals family have agreed to formalize an internal policy that follows the most recent ISSCR recommendations (http://www.isscr.org/membership/policy/2016-guidelines/guidelines-for-stem-cell-research-and-clinical-translation/) for human embryo, gamete, or ESC research.In accordance with this policy and in keeping with current community standards, Nature Research Journals, including Nature Medicine, will continue to refrain from considering studies that maintain human embryos or embryo-like organized structures in culture beyond the 14-day period that typically coincides with the emergence of the primitive streak, an early event that is thought to mark the acquisition of human organismal potential. Furthermore, our editorial team will continue to seek independent ethical evaluation alongside the traditional scientific peer review process for certain types of studies on a case-by-case basis, such as those that employ genomic engineering techniques in human embryos or oocytes. As part of our ongoing efforts to promote transparency in our research communications, we will also require that studies under consideration in these areas be accompanied by an Ethics Statement from the authors that identifies the committee(s) responsible for approving the research, reports the confirmation of informed consent from the relevant human donors or recipients, and describes the conditions under which donated material was obtained.From a mechanistic perspective, research that employs human gametes or embryos is required to gain a better understanding of the processes that can give rise to pathological chromosomal abnormalities during gametogenesis or embryogenesis, which might be found in as many as 10% of oocytes. In this regard, it is important to consider that most of the research conducted in this area relies on egg cells and embryos that have been donated from in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics. It remains unknown whether results from these donated cells and embryos, which typically come from couples with reproductive problems that prevent them from conceiving a child, are the most informative for an understanding of normal human embryonic development. As a complementary approach, some investigators are turning toward the use of gametes or embryo-like structures derived or assembled from iPSCs.Ethically responsible and transparent research will be necessary to address many unanswered questions and to fill the unmet clinical needs of both the general public and the reproductive biology research community. For example, improvements are needed to establish better, objective criteria for selecting embryos generated from IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) that have the highest likelihood for successful implantation. There is a growing need for these insights as more people turn to assistive reproductive technology (ART). For example, last year in the United States, the number of babies born as a result of ART surpassed 1 million. And relaxation of China’s so-called one-child policy in 2013 has led to an increase in demand for ARTs that may be mirrored globally as populations age and couples wait until later in life to conceive.We are just a few weeks away from celebrating the 40th birthday of the first individual successfully conceived by IVF. It is an appropriate time, therefore, to consider how to ensure that reproductive medicine research is conducted responsibly, as well as what the future holds for fundamental human embryonic development research and translational and clinical reproductive medicine. As a publisher of both translational and clinical research, Nature Medicine recognizes that standards are likely to evolve alongside technical and conceptual advances in the field, but is also committed to the responsibility that scientific progress must be accomplished in an ethical manner.", "doi": "10.1038/s41591-018-0072-0", "authors": "", "_if": "", "issn": "1546-170X"},

Advancing age is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease because of the lifelong exposure to cardiovascular risk factors and specific alterations affecting the heart and the vasculature during ageing. Indeed, the ageing heart is characterized by structural and functional changes that are caused by alterations in fundamental cardiomyocyte functions. In particular, the myocardium is heavily dependent on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and is especially susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction. Indeed, primary alterations in mitochondrial function, which are subsequently amplified by defective quality control mechanisms, are considered to be major contributing factors to cardiac senescence. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms linking defective mitochondrial quality control mechanisms (that is, proteostasis, biogenesis, dynamics, and autophagy) to organelle dysfunction in the context of cardiac ageing. We also illustrate relevant molecular pathways that might be exploited for the prevention and treatment of age-related heart dysfunction.", "doi": "10.1038/s41569-018-0059-z", "authors": ["Anna Picca", "Robert T.

Mitigation of cardiac functional decline in an ageing organism requires the activation of enhanced maintenance and reparative capacity, thereby overcoming inherent endogenous limitations to retaining a youthful phenotype. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulation of cellular function and renewal reveals potential interventional targets to attenuate degenerative processes at the cellular and systemic levels to improve quality of life for our ageing population.

Ever since those first visionary speculations, autoimmune disease has proven to be a unique conceptual and medical challenge. Although much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of autoimmune disease and the nature of self-tolerance, effective and highly targeted treatments have proven elusive. Indeed, autoimmune disease remains a major burden on health systems around the world, with type 1 diabetes in the USA alone accounting annually for ~$14 billion in medical costs and lost income. In this Focus, Nature Immunology presents a collection of five Reviews covering multiple aspects of autoimmune disease, from its underlying causes to therapeutic interventions. All of the Reviews are freely available for 6 months after going live online (www.nature.com/collections/autoimmune-disease).Implicit in Ehrlich’s original description of ‘horror autotoxicus’ was the understanding that host mechanisms to prevent the development of a damaging autoreactive response must be in operation. The first of these mechanisms is central tolerance carried out within the thymus. In their Review, Mickie Cheng and Mark S. Anderson provide an update on the understanding of thymic tolerance and, in particular, the key roles of the transcription factors Aire and Fezf2 and the distinct repertoires of self proteins that they regulate. A second and no-less-important layer of tolerance is mediated outside of the thymus, and chief among these peripheral tolerance mechanisms are regulatory T cells (Treg cells). Margarita Dominguez-Villar and David A. Hafler describe the critical function of Treg cells in preventing autoimmune disease. More specifically, they consider the emerging concept of Treg cell instability, a phenomenon now thought to be relevant for impairment of the suppressive function of Treg cells, particularly in the inflammatory conditions seen during autoimmune responses. On the flip side, Treg cells also need to demonstrate a surprising degree of physiological plasticity that seems to be essential for their ability to tailor suppressive functions to specific forms of immune responses.While much conjecture surrounds the underlying causes of autoimmune disease, the effect of host genetics is indisputable. Indeed, genome-wide association studies have yielded a bounty of information about the polygenetic basis of autoimmune disease, although parsing this vast corpus of knowledge comes with its own challenges. John A. Todd and colleagues review advances in the tools and approaches in the genetic analysis of autoimmune disease and describe how data can be effectively mined to identify relevant causal genes and pathways. It will almost certainly be insights from such studies as these that will lead to effective therapies in the future.The past few decades have witnessed a sharp rise in the incidence of autoimmune diseases in the developed world that far outstrips any possible changes that could be accounted for by genetics. All evidence points to important alterations in the environment, and in particular dietary and microbial exposure, whether pathogen or otherwise. In their Review, Elena Verdu and Jayne S. Danska discuss the dietary and microbial influences on type 1 diabetes and draw parallels with celiac disease, which is triggered by the recognition of ingested gluten proteins by immune cells. Understanding these influences offers hope for dietary intervention strategies in the modulation of type 1 diabetes and potentially other autoimmune diseases.With few exceptions, autoimmune diseases have proven very challenging to treat, much less to ‘cure’. Multiple sclerosis, one of the more debilitating autoimmune diseases, is thought to be caused in large part by the action of autoreactive CD4+ T cells. In recent years, however, an unexpected and important pathophysiological role for B cells in multiple sclerosis has been demonstrated. Amit Bar-Or and colleagues lay out the evidence for antibody-independent B cell–mediated pathology in multiple sclerosis and how such insights have led to unexpectedly effective biologic therapies, such as treatment with antibody to the B cell–specific surface antigen CD20.More than 100 years ago, Ehrlich reflected on the nightmare scenario of the immune system attacking its host, a nightmare that was soon demonstrated to be all too real. Thankfully, substantial advances in fundamental immunology have shed light on the basis of autoimmune disease and are finally offering the possibility of effective treatment, and perhaps even a cure. Nature Immunology hopes that this collection of Reviews will inform readers interested in this important topic.

{"title": "New drugs in AML: uses and abuses", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-018-0168-z", "source": "Leukemia 2018 32:7", "pub_date": "2018-06-06", "abstract": "                                                    Many persons with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are excluded from new drug studies for diverse reasons such as a poor performance score, abnormal kidney, liver or heart function, infection with hepatitis or human immune deficiency-related viruses, tests performed outside narrow-specified time intervals, co-morbidities, frailty, or a prior cancer even when risk of recurrence is extremely low [1]. These exclusions drastically limit clinical trials eligibility, especially in older persons, given the 65–70-year median age of diagnosis. For example, the risk of having a non-fatal solid neoplasm by the age 70 is >20%, with an annual rate of 1.5% [2].Research into exclusions from oncology clinical trials has focused almost exclusively on persons with solid neoplasms [3]. A recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) study reported that 63% of 284 commercial investigational new drug (IND) applications for cancer in adults in 2015 limited eligibility to subjects with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score <2. Only 1% allowed the enrollment of subjects with an ECOG performance score of 3 [4]. Similarly, data from the Kaiser Permanente Practice Group estimated that 61% of >12,000 persons with breast, lung, or colorectal cancers would be excluded from the typical clinical trials in these diseases [5].A subtler but more common bias operates when otherwise-eligible persons are not even considered for a clinical trial, often because of the perception that they would be a poor study candidate. Unfortunately, most studies do not report the number of persons screened, enrolled, or excluded as a proportion of eligible persons; and this does not include the large numbers of subjects never screened or referred to a study site. For example, in the United States, 60% of persons >66 years with AML receive no therapy within 3 months of diagnosis [6]. On the basis of these considerations, we estimate that <10% and probably <5% of persons with AML enter the clinical trials, a rate similar to solid neoplasms. It would be naive not to suspect excluding subjects from the trials reflects a desire to make the results look as good as possible, thereby increasing the likelihood of health authority approval and/or publication, although these exclusions are understandable in view of the time, effort, and costs of drug development,Although our first issue involves systemic, unquantified selection biases, the second, ironically, is unrestricted use of drugs post approval. Some of the fault rests with the health authorities [7]. For example, although the trial leading to FDA approval of midostaurin enrolled only subjects <60 years, approval is for all adults with an FLT3 mutation, including those >60 years, where the risk/benefit ratio of midostaurin is unstudied [8] (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/207997s000lbl.pdf). Although FLT3 mutations are less common in people aged >60 years compared with younger persons (15% vs. 25%), most persons with AML are >60 years [9,10,11]. Consequently, considerable use of midostaurin will likely occur in this untested setting. Similarly, although the trial reporting a survival advantage for CPX-351 over conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin enrolled only subjects 60–75 years with secondary AML, the FDA approval has no age restriction [12, 13] (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm569950.htm). We anticipate widespread CPX-351 use in the unstudied group of younger AML persons, while noting that defining a case of AML as secondary is necessarily probabilistic and often inaccurate [14].Current drug approval policies are thusly problematic because: (1) they do not quantify the effects of selection biases in the trials on which the approval is based [1, 15]; and (2) they grant de facto approval in clinical settings in which the drug was not tested for safety or efficacy, ignoring the likelihood that the drug will be used in these settings. Given the shortcoming of post-approval surveillance mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that unfavorable outcomes would be reported at all or with as much publicity accompanying the trial(s) on which the approval was based.", "doi": "10.1038/s41375-018-0168-z", "authors": ["Elihu H.

There is conflicting evidence on the prognostic relevance of these clones for AML relapse. Here, we characterized paired pre-treatment and remission samples from 126 AML patients for mutations in 68 leukemia-associated genes. Fifty patients (40%) retained ≥1 mutation during remission at a VAF of ≥2%. Mutation persistence was most frequent in DNMT3A (65% of patients with mutations at diagnosis), SRSF2 (64%), TET2 (55%), and ASXL1 (46%), and significantly associated with older age (p < 0.0001) and, in multivariate analyses adjusting for age, genetic risk, and allogeneic transplantation, with inferior relapse-free survival (hazard ratio (HR), 2.34; p = 0.0039) and overall survival (HR, 2.14; p = 0.036). Patients with persisting mutations had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse before, but not after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Our work underlines the relevance of mutation persistence during first remission as a novel risk factor in AML. Persistence of pre-leukemic clones may contribute to the inferior outcome of elderly AML patients. Allogeneic transplantation abrogated the increased relapse risk associated with persisting pre-leukemic clones, suggesting that mutation persistence may guide post-remission treatment.", "doi": "10.1038/s41375-018-0034-z", "authors": ["Maja Rothenberg-Thurley", "Susanne Amler", "Dennis Goerlich", "Thomas Köhnke", "Nikola P.

Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein-32A (ANP32A) participates in histone acetylation and its role in acute myeloid leukemia remains unclear. Here we observed significant upregulation of ANP32A in primary AML cells, which was essential for AML cell proliferation, survival, and colony formation. Integrative analysis of the genome-wide histone H3 acetylation and gene expression demonstrated that ANP32A deficiency reduced histone H3 acetylation, in accordance with changes in gene expression. Notably, significant histone H3 acetylation enrichment was associated with mRNA changes in lipid-related genes, including APOC1, PCSK9, P2RX1, and LPPR3. Indeed, over-expression of APOC1 partially compensated the proliferation-defect phenotype in ANP32A deficient AML cells while APOC1 knockdown alone mimicked the effect of ANP32A deficiency. Collectively, our data indicate that ANP32A is a novel regulator of histone H3 acetylation and promotes leukemogenesis.", "doi": "10.1038/s41375-018-0010-7", "authors": ["Xuejing Yang", "Bin Lu", "Xueqin Sun", "Cuijuan Han", "Chunling Fu", "Kailin Xu", "Min Wang", "Dengju Li", "Zhichao Chen", "Puneet Opal", "Qiang Wen", "John D.

We conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to investigate the association of treatment type (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], acute myeloid leukemia [AML], or “hybrid” regimens), disease response, and survival. We searched seven databases from inception through June 2017 without age or language restriction. Included studies reported sufficient treatment detail for de novo MPAL classified according to the well-established European Group for Immunological Characterization of Acute Leukemias (EGIL) or World Health Organization (WHO2008) criteria. Meta-analyses and multivariable analyses of a patient-level compiled case series were performed for the endpoints of complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS). We identified 97 reports from 33 countries meeting criteria, resulting in 1,499 unique patients with data, of whom 1,351 had sufficient detail for quantitative analysis of the study endpoints. Using either definition of MPAL, meta-analyses revealed that AML induction was less likely to achieve a CR as compared to ALL regimens, (WHO2008 odds ratio [OR] = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.18–0.58; EGIL, OR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.08–0.40). Multivariable analysis of the patient-level data supported poorer efficacy for AML induction (versus ALL: OR = 0.45 95% CI 0.27–0.77). Meta-analyses similarly found better OS for those beginning with ALL versus AML therapy (WHO2008 OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.77; EGIL, OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.24–0.78), but multivariable analysis of patient-level data showed only those starting with hybrid therapy fared worse (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, 95% CI 1.30–3.43). MPAL definition did not impact trends within each endpoint and were similarly predictive of outcome. Using either definition of MPAL, ALL-therapy is associated with higher initial remission rates for MPAL and is at least equivalent to more intensive AML therapy for long-term survival. Prospective trials are needed to establish a uniform approach to this heterogeneous disease.", "doi": "10.1038/s41375-018-0058-4", "authors": ["Maria Maruffi", "Richard Sposto", "Matthew J Oberley", "Lynn Kysh", "Etan Orgel"], "_if": "", "issn": "1476-5551"},

In adult marrow, cells expressing similar markers are also found, but at very low frequency. These adult-derived cells can be extensively culture expanded in vitro without loss of potential, they preserve a biased hemogenic transcriptional profile, and, upon in vitro induction with Oct4, assume a hematopoietic phenotype. In vivo, these cells, upon transplantation into a fetal microenvironment, contribute to the vasculature, and generate hematopoietic cells that provide multilineage repopulation upon serial transplantation. The identification of this human somatic cell population provides novel insights into human ontogenetic hematovascular potential, which could lead to a better understanding of, and new target therapies for, malignant and nonmalignant hematologic disorders.", "doi": "10.1038/s41375-018-0016-1", "authors": ["Saloomeh Mokhtari", "Evan Colletti", "Weihong Yin", "Chad Sanada", "Zanetta Lamar", "Paul J.

These vectors have also been used to introduce genes into mature T cells to generate immunity to cancer through the delivery of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or cloned T-cell receptors.

Among 641 cytogenetically annotated patients with PMF and informative for previously recognized adverse mutations, multivariable analysis identified “VHR” karyotype, “unfavorable” karyotype, absence of type 1/like CALR mutation and presence of ASXL1, SRSF2, or U2AF1Q157 mutation, as inter-independent predictors of inferior survival; the respective HRs (95% CI) were 3.1 (2.1–4.3), 2.1 (1.6–2.7), 2.1 (1.6–2.9), 1.8 (1.5–2.3), 2.4 (1.9–3.2), and 2.4 (1.7–3.3).

More recently, our understanding of the role of an increasing number of inherited genetic factors on MDS/AML risk and management has rapidly progressed. In recognition of the growing impact of this field, clinical guidelines and disease classification systems for both MDS and AML have recently incorporated familial MDS/AML predisposition syndromes into their diagnostic algorithms. In this perspective piece, we contemplate the advantages, disadvantages, and barriers that would need to be overcome to incorporate inherited MDS/AML genetic testing into the upfront molecular diagnostic work-up of every MDS/AML patient. For centers already performing panel-based tumor-only testing, including genes associated with familial forms of MDS/AML (e.g., RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, TP53), we advocate optimizing these tests to detect all types of germline variants in these genes and moving toward upfront paired tumor/germline testing to maximize detection and streamline patient care.", "doi": "10.1038/s41375-018-0051-y", "authors": ["Kiran Tawana", "Michael W.

SNP 6.0 or CytoscanHD Array (Affymetrix®) were performed on all samples. We detected chromothripsis with a custom algorithm in 26/395 patients. Patients harboring chromothripsis had higher age (p = 0.002), ELN high risk (HR) (p < 0.001), lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.040), TP53 loss, and/or mutations (p < 0.001) while FLT3 (p = 0.025), and NPM1 (p = 0.032) mutations were mutually exclusive with chromothripsis. Chromothripsis-positive patients showed a worse overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001) compared with HR patients (p = 0.011) and a poor prognosis in a COX-HR optimal regression model. Chromothripsis presented the hallmarks of chromosome instability [i.e., TP53 alteration, 5q deletion, higher mean of copy number alteration (CNA), complex karyotype, alterations in DNA repair, and cell cycle] and focal deletions on chromosomes 4, 7, 12, 16, and 17.

MSCs can migrate towards primary tumours and metastatic sites, implying that these cells might modulate tumour growth and metastasis. However, this issue remains controversial and is not well understood. Interestingly, several recent studies have shown functional abnormalities of MM patient-derived MSCs indicating that MSCs are not just by-standers in the BM microenvironment but rather active players in the pathophysiology of this disease.

We propose that stochastic temporal variations in blood flow and microenvironmental conditions arise from the eco-evolutionary dynamics of tumour angiogenesis in which cancer cells, as individual units of selection, can influence and respond only to local environmental conditions. This leads to new vessels arising from the closest available vascular structure regardless of the size or capacity of this parental vessel. These dynamics produce unstable vascular networks with unpredictable spatial and temporal variations in blood flow and microenvironmental conditions. Adaptations of evolving populations to temporally varying environments in nature include increased diversity, greater motility and invasiveness, and highly plastic phenotypes, allowing for broad metabolic adaptability and rapid shifts to high rates of proliferation and profound quiescence. These adaptive strategies, when adopted in cancer cells, promote many commonly observed phenotypic properties including those found in the stem phenotype and in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Temporal variations in intratumoural blood flow, which occur through the promotion of cancer cell phenotypes that facilitate both metastatic spread and resistance to therapy, may have substantial clinical consequences.", "doi": "10.1038/s41568-018-0030-7", "authors": ["Robert J.
