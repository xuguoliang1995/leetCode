{'abstract': 'Purpose: Immunotherapeutic treatment strategies for glioblastoma '

             'TCR sequencing was performed on paired samples of newly '

             'repertoire clonality and a more activated memory phenotype were '

             'DNA released in NETosis triggered neutrophilia upon allergen '
             'exposure, and cytoplasts alone were sufficient to induce IL-17 '

             'correlated with IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid '

             'milder asthma with type 2 eosinophilic inflammation. New '

             'to allergen alone during later airway challenge. Unlike allergen '

             'In addition to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), enucleated '
             'neutrophil cytoplasts were evident in the lungs. Surprisingly, '

             'cytoplasts were also present in mediastinal lymph nodes, and the '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Sixty percent of papillary thyroid cancers (PTC) have '
             'an oncogenic (V600E) BRAF mutation. Inhibitors of BRAF and its '
             'substrates MEK1/2 are showing clinical promise in BRAFV600E PTC. '
             'PTC progression can be decades long, which is challenging in '
             'terms of toxicity and cost. We previously found that MEK1/2 '
             'require copper (Cu) for kinase activity and can be inhibited '
             'with the well-tolerated and economical Cu chelator '
             'tetrathiomolybdate (TM). We therefore tested TM for '
             'antineoplastic activity in BRAFV600E -positive PTC.  '
             'Experimental Design: The efficacy of TM alone and in combination '
             'with current standard-of-care lenvatinib and sorafenib or BRAF '
             'and MEK1/2 inhibitors vemurafenib and trametinib was examined in '
             'BRAFV600 E-positive human PTC cell lines and a genetically '
             'engineered mouse PTC model.  Results: TM inhibited MEK1/2 kinase '
             'activity and transformed growth of PTC cells. TM was as or more '
             'potent than lenvatinib and sorafenib and enhanced the '
             'antineoplastic activity of sorafenib and vemurafenib. Activated '
             'ERK2, a substrate of MEK1/2, overcame this effect, consistent '
             'with TM deriving its antineoplastic activity by inhibiting '
             'MEK1/2. Oral TM reduced tumor burden and vemurafenib in a '
             'BrafV600E -positive mouse model of PTC. This effect was ascribed '
             'to a reduction of Cu in the tumors. TM reduced P-Erk1/2 in mouse '
             'PTC tumors, whereas genetic reduction of Cu in developing tumors '
             'trended towards a survival advantage. Finally, TM as a '
             'maintenance therapy after cessation of vemurafenib reduced tumor '
             'volume in the aforementioned PTC mouse model.  Conclusions: TM '
             'inhibits BRAFV600E -driven PTC through inhibition of MEK1/2, '

             'toward mutual exclusivity was seen between multiple genes in '
             'intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma including TP53:IDH1, IDH1:KRAS, '
             'TP53:BAP1 , and IDH1:FGFR2 . Alterations in CDKN2A/B and ERBB2 '
             'were associated with reduced survival and time to progression on '
             'chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic '
             'disease. Genetic alterations with potential therapeutic '

{'abstract': 'Chronic joint pain such as mechanical allodynia is the most '
             'debilitating symptom of arthritis, yet effective therapies are '
             'lacking. We identify the pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel as a '
             'therapeutic target for alleviating mechanical allodynia, a '
             'cardinal sign of arthritis. In rats, joint pain caused by '
             'intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) was '
             'associated with spinal adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) release '
             'and a microglia-specific up-regulation of P2X7 receptors '
             '(P2X7Rs). Blockade of P2X7R or ablation of spinal microglia '
             'prevented and reversed mechanical allodynia. P2X7Rs drive Panx1 '
             'channel activation, and in rats with mechanical allodynia, Panx1 '
             'function was increased in spinal microglia. Specifically, '
             'microglial Panx1-mediated release of the proinflammatory '
             'cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induced mechanical allodynia in '
             'the MIA-injected hindlimb. Intrathecal administration of the '
             'Panx1-blocking peptide 10panx suppressed the aberrant discharge '
             'of spinal laminae I-II neurons evoked by innocuous mechanical '
             'hindpaw stimulation in arthritic rats. Furthermore, mice with a '
             'microglia-specific genetic deletion of Panx1 were protected from '
             'developing mechanical allodynia. Treatment with probenecid, a '
             'clinically used broad-spectrum Panx1 blocker, resulted in a '
             'striking attenuation of MIA-induced mechanical allodynia and '
             'normalized responses in the dynamic weight-bearing test, without '
             'affecting acute nociception. Probenecid reversal of mechanical '
             'allodynia was also observed in rats 13 weeks after anterior '
             'cruciate ligament transection, a model of posttraumatic '

{'abstract': 'Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition resulting from '
             'nerve damage. Often, patients do not achieve pain relief with '
             'currently available therapies. A better understanding of the '
             'mechanisms mediating neuropathic pain could help to identify '
             'more effective therapies. Now, Tramullas et al . show that '
             'neuropathic pain in rodents was associated with increased '
             'expression of the microRNA miR-30c-5p in the brain, '
             'cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma. In addition, miR-30c-5p was '
             'up-regulated in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid from patients '
             'with peripheral ischemia–induced pain. Inhibiting this microRNA '
             'in the rodent model produced analgesic effects. The results '
             'suggest that targeting miR-30c-5p might be an effective strategy '
             'for treating neuropathic pain.  Neuropathic pain is a '
             'debilitating chronic syndrome that is often refractory to '
             'currently available analgesics. Aberrant expression of several '
             'microRNAs (miRNAs) in nociception-related neural structures is '
             'associated with neuropathic pain in rodent models. We have '
             'exploited the antiallodynic phenotype of mice lacking the bone '
             'morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor '
             '(BAMBI), a transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) pseudoreceptor. '
             'We used these mice to identify new miRNAs that might be useful '
             'for diagnosing, treating, or predicting neuropathic pain. We '
             'show that, after sciatic nerve injury in rats, miR-30c-5p was '
             'up-regulated in the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, '
             'cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma and that the expression of '
             'miR-30c-5p positively correlated with the severity of allodynia. '
             'The administration of a miR-30c-5p inhibitor into the cisterna '
             'magna of the brain delayed neuropathic pain development and '
             'reversed fully established allodynia in rodents. The mechanism '
             'was mediated by TGF-β and involved the endogenous opioid system. '
             'In patients with neuropathic pain associated with leg ischemia, '
             'the expression of miR-30c-5p was increased in plasma and CSF '
             'compared to control patients without pain. Logistic regression '
             'analysis in our cohort of patients showed that the expression of '
             'miR-30c-5p in plasma and CSF, in combination with other clinical '
             'variables, might be useful to help to predict neuropathic pain '

{'abstract': 'DNA sequence and epigenetic information embedded in chromatin '

             'chromatin assembly and maintenance of replication fork '

             'lack of TLK activity leads to replication fork stalling and the '

             'matrix that leads to fibrosis of the liver. The authors suggest '
             'that circulating EDPs might be useful as (relatively) '
             'noninvasive biomarkers to diagnose risk for NASH. They also hint '
             'that targeting aging and the preservation of elastic fibers in '
             'blood vessels might be an option for therapy against the '
             'disease. Using a series of mouse models, cell-based experiments, '
             'and a clinical investigation, the authors show that increases in '
             'neutrophil elastase activity resulting from activation by EDPs '
             'lead to an accumulation of free fatty acids, liver '
             'triglycerides, and hepatic collagen and impairment of the AMPK '
             'pathway. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme '
             'reversed the effects and restored AMPK signaling. In human '
             'subjects with obesity, they found that participants with type 2 '
             'diabetes also had increased circulating levels of EDPs in '
             'comparison to participants without diabetes and that EDPs and '
             'neutrophil elastase activity correlated with scoring approaches '
             'for fatty liver and fibrosis—hence the suggestion that they '
             'might be useful as plasma biomarkers. Author Sébastien Blaise '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Cancer stem-like cells (CSC) contribute to the '
             'progression and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) resistance of '
             'prostate cancer. As CSCs depend on their specific niche, '
             'including tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), elucidating the '
             'network between CSCs and TAMs may help to effectively inhibit '
             'the progression and ADT resistance of prostate cancer.  '
             'Experimental Design: The underlying intracellular mechanism that '
             'sustains the stem-like characteristics of CSCs in prostate '
             'cancer was assessed via RNA sequencing, co-immunoprecipitation, '
             'chromatin immunoprecipitation, and other assays. A coculture '
             'system and cytokine antibody arrays were used to examine the '
             'interaction network between CSCs and TAMs. In addition, an '
             'orthotopic prostate cancer model was established to evaluate the '
             'in vivo effects of the combined targeting of CSCs and their '
             'interaction with TAMs on ADT resistance.  Results: '
             'Autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) facilitated the transcription of '
             'OCT4 via β-catenin, which binds to the OCT4 promoter, promoting '
             'CSC characteristics in prostate cancer, including self-renewal, '
             'tumor initiation, and drug resistance. In addition, CSCs '
             'remodeled their specific niche by educating '
             'monocytes/macrophages toward TAMs, and the CSC-educated TAMs '
             'reciprocally promoted the stem-like properties of CSCs, '
             'progression and ADT resistance of prostate cancer via IL6/STAT3. '
             'Furthermore, the combined targeting of CSCs and their '
             'interaction with TAMs by inhibiting ATG7/OCT4 and IL6 receptor '
             'effectively ameliorated ADT resistance in an orthotopic prostate '
             'cancer model.  Conclusions: Targeting CSCs and their niche may '
             'prove to be a more powerful strategy than targeting CSCs alone, '

{'abstract': 'Background:Human cadaver surgical skills training offers the '
             'highest-fidelity simulation of the operative environment, with '
             'the potential to enhance surgeon training and to reduce '
             'operative risks to patients. Embalming extends the duration that '
             'a cadaveric specimen may be used for surgical skills training '
             'and reduces the risk of disease transmission, but it can alter '
             'the properties of the cadaver tissue, reducing the simulation '
             'fidelity and training quality. The purpose of this controlled '
             'laboratory study was to evaluate 3 embalming methods, '
             'formaldehyde solution, alcohol-glycol solution, and saturated '
             'salt solution, and to compare their relative performance in a '
             '2-week orthopaedic surgical skills training course.Methods:The 3 '
             'embalming methods were applied to 3 cadavers each. Joint range '
             'of motion and joint stiffness were measured prior to dissection. '
             'The cadavers were assessed by 4 orthopaedic surgeons on the '
             'first and last days of the training course in 4 domains: tissue '
             'visual fidelity, tissue tactile fidelity, odor, and overall '
             'suitability for surgical skills training using 7-point Likert '
             'scales. Sterile specimens for bacterial and fungal culture were '
             'obtained from cadaver muscle tissue on the fourth and fifteenth '
             'days of use.Results:All cadaver groups were successfully '
             'preserved without putrefaction and were utilized over the '
             'duration of the training course. The saturated salt solution '
             'cadavers had supple joints with excellent motion and were rated '
             'highly across all domains. The saturated salt solution cadaver '
             'joint motion, stiffness, visual and tactile tissue fidelity, '
             'odor, and suitability for surgical skills training were '
             'significantly superior (p &lt; 0.05) to the formaldehyde '
             'solution and alcohol-glycol solution cadavers.Conclusions:The '
             'saturated salt embalming method is inexpensive and logistically '

             'Evans et al. measured the isotopic composition of water in Lake '
             'Chichancanab, Mexico, to quantify how much precipitation '
             'decreased during that period. Annual rainfall must have fallen '

             'conditions.  Science , this issue p. [498][1]  The demise of '
             'Lowland Classic Maya civilization during the Terminal Classic '
             'Period (~800 to 1000 CE) is a well-cited example of how past '

             'estimate the magnitude of hydrologic change, however, have met '
             'with equivocal success because of the qualitative and indirect '
             'nature of available climate proxy data. We reconstructed the '
             'past isotopic composition (δ18O, δD, 17O-excess, and d-excess) '
             'of water in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that '

             'sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under drought '
             'conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope data provide '
             'a direct measure of past changes in lake hydrology. We modeled '
             'the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased '
             'between 41 and 54% (with intervals of up to 70% rainfall '

             'mice and concurrent reduction in bone formation, which was '
             'associated with decreased Thy-1 expression on MSCs. Obese human '
             'subjects and subjects with osteoporosis showed reductions in '

             'bone formation and adipose tissue development in vivo. MSCs from '
             'Thy-1–deficient mice have decreased osteoblast differentiation '
             'and increased adipogenic differentiation compared to MSCs from '
             'wild-type mice. Consistently, Thy-1–deficient mice exhibited '
             'decreased bone volume and bone formation rate with elevated '
             'cortical porosity, resulting in lower bone strength. In '
             'parallel, body weight, subcutaneous/epigonadal fat mass, and '
             'bone fat volume were increased. Thy-1 deficiency was accompanied '
             'by reduced expression of specific Wnt ligands with simultaneous '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: The blockade of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1 and '
             'PD-1 is being exploited therapeutically in several types of '
             'malignancies. Here, we aimed to understand the contribution of '
             'the genetics of lung cancer to the ability of tumor cells to '
             'escape immunosurveillance checkpoints.  Experimental Design: '
             'More than 150 primary non–small cell lung cancers, including '
             'pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas, were tested for levels of the '
             'HLA-I complex, PD-L1, tumor-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes, and '
             'alterations in main lung cancer genes. Correlations were '
             'validated in cancer cell lines using appropriate treatments to '
             'activate or inhibit selected pathways. We also performed RNA '
             'sequencing to assess changes in gene expression after these '
             'treatments.  Results: MET- oncogenic activation tended to '
             'associate with positive PD-L1 immunostaining, whereas STK11 '
             'mutations were correlated with negative immunostaining. In MET- '
             'altered cancer cells, MET triggered a transcriptional increase '
             'of PD-L1 that was independent of the IFNγ-mediated JAK/STAT '
             'pathway. The activation of MET also upregulated other '
             'immunosuppressive genes ( PDCD1LG2 and SOCS1 ) and transcripts '
             'involved in angiogenesis ( VEGFA and NRP1 ) and in cell '
             'proliferation. We also report recurrent inactivating mutations '
             'in JAK2 that co-occur with alterations in MET and STK11 , which '
             'prevented the induction of immunoresponse-related genes '
             'following treatment with IFNγ.  Conclusions: We show that MET '
             'activation promotes the expression of several negative '
             'checkpoint regulators of the immunoresponse, including PD-L1. In '
             'addition, we report inactivation of JAK2 in lung cancer cells '
             'that prevented the response to IFNγ. These alterations are '
             'likely to facilitate tumor growth by enabling immune tolerance '
             'and may affect the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. '

{'abstract': 'Recent international negotiations have highlighted the need to '

{'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn patients with diabetes, hospitalization can '
             'complicate the achievement of recommended glycemic targets. '
             'There is increasing evidence that a closed-loop delivery system '
             '(artificial pancreas) can improve glucose control in patients '
             'with type 1 diabetes. We wanted to investigate whether a '
             'closed-loop system could also improve glycemic control in '
             'patients with type 2 diabetes who were receiving noncritical '
             'care.MethodsIn this randomized, open-label trial conducted on '
             'general wards in two tertiary hospitals located in the United '
             'Kingdom and Switzerland, we assigned 136 adults with type 2 '
             'diabetes who required subcutaneous insulin therapy to receive '
             'either closed-loop insulin delivery (70 patients) or '
             'conventional subcutaneous insulin therapy, according to local '
             'clinical practice (66 patients). The primary end point was the '
             'percentage of time that the sensor glucose measurement was '
             'within the target range of 100 to 180 mg per deciliter (5.6 to '
             '10.0 mmol per liter) for up to 15 days or until hospital '
             'discharge.ResultsThe mean (±SD) percentage of time that the '
             'sensor glucose measurement was in the target range was '
             '65.8±16.8% in the closed-loop group and 41.5±16.9% in the '

             'confidence interval [CI], 18.6 to 30.0; P<0.001); values above '
             'the target range were found in 23.6±16.6% and 49.5±22.8% of the '

             'points (95% CI, 19.2 to 32.7; P<0.001). The mean glucose level '
             'was 154 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter) in the closed-loop '
             'group and 188 mg per deciliter (10.4 mmol per liter) in the '
             'control group (P<0.001). There was no significant between-group '

             'four methylation subtypes of EAC and BE. The high methylator '
             'subtype (HM) of EAC had the greatest number of activating events '
             'in ERBB2 (p<0.05, Student’s t-test) and the highest global '

             'Inhibition of PTPN13 expression in the SK-GT-4 EAC cell line '

{'abstract': 'Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is difficult to diagnose and can '
             'sometimes be confused with pancreatic cancer, which presents '
             'with similar symptoms. AIP is an inflammatory disease involving '
             'elevated IgG4, but the target autoantigen(s) is unidentified. '
             'This group’s previous work pointed to the extracellular matrix, '
             'and now, Shiokawa et al . show that a truncated form of laminin '
             '511 may be a major autoantigen in AIP. They observed that half '
             'of AIP patients they analyzed had anti–laminin 511 antibodies, '
             'which were absent in healthy controls. Patient pancreatic '
             'tissues were positive for laminin 511, and immunization of mice '
             'with this protein induced AIP-like symptoms. These results '
             'reveal an autoimmune target in this disease and one day may aid '
             'AIP diagnosis.  Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), a major '
             'manifestation of immunoglobulin G4–related disease (IgG4-RD), is '
             'an immune-mediated disorder, but the target autoantigens are '
             'still unknown. We previously reported that IgG in patients with '
             'AIP induces pancreatic injuries in mice by binding the '
             'extracellular matrix (ECM). In the current study, we identified '
             'an autoantibody against laminin 511-E8, a truncated laminin 511, '
             'one of the ECM proteins, in patients with AIP. Anti–laminin '
             '511-E8 IgG was present in 26 of 51 AIP patients (51.0%), but '
             'only in 2 of 122 controls (1.6%), by enzyme-linked immunosorbent '
             'assay. Because truncated forms of other laminin family members '
             'in other organs have been reported, we confirmed that truncated '
             'forms of laminin 511 also exist in human and mouse pancreas. '
             'Histologic studies with patient pancreatic tissues showed '
             'colocalization of patient IgG and laminin 511. Immunization of '
             'mice with human laminin 511-E8 induced antibodies and pancreatic '
             'injury, fulfilling the pathologic criteria for human AIP. Four '
             'of 25 AIP patients without laminin 511-E8 antibodies had '
             'antibodies against integrin α6β1, a laminin 511 ligand. AIP '
             'patients with laminin 511-E8 antibodies exhibited distinctive '
             'clinical features, as the frequencies of malignancies or '

             'non-classical monocytes (which are CD115 positive, but low in '
             'Ly6C and CCR2), in serving as precursors for OC in arthritis is '
             'still elusive.  Methods We investigated CCR2−/− mice, which lack '
             'circulating classical monocytes, crossed into hTNFtg mice for '
             'the extent of joint damage. We analysed monocyte subsets in '
             'hTNFtg and K/BxN serum transfer arthritis by flow cytometry. We '
             'sorted monocyte subsets and analysed their potential to '

             'Experimental Design: We examined FIT-039 for its effect on HPV '
             'gene expression in HPV+ cervical cancer cells. Primary '
             'keratinocytes monolayer and organotypic raft culture models were '
             'used to evaluate HPV viral replication and cervical '
             'intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) phenotypes. Preclinical '
             'pharmacokinetics and toxicity tests for FIT-039 were also '
             'conducted. Finally, the anti-HPV effect of FIT-039 was further '
             'examined in vivo , using HPV+ cervical cancer xenografts.  '
             'Results: FIT-039 inhibits HPV replication and expression of E6 '
             'and E7 viral oncogenes, restoring tumor suppressors p53 and pRb '
             'in HPV+ cervical cancer cells. The therapeutic effect of FIT-039 '
             'was demonstrated in CIN model of an organotypic raft culture, '
             'where FIT-039 suppressed HPV18-induced '
             'dysplasia/hyperproliferation with reduction in viral load. '
             'FIT-039 also repressed growth of HPV16+, but not HPV− cervical '

             'Safety and pharmacokinetics of FIT-039 were confirmed for '

             'FIT-039 showed potent anti-HPV activity without significant '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription '
             'factor FOXP3 are essential for the maintenance of immunological '
             'self-tolerance but play a detrimental role in most cancers due '
             'to their ability to suppress antitumor immunity. The phenotype '
             'of human circulating Treg cells has been extensively studied, '
             'but less is known about tumor-infiltrating Treg cells. We '
             'studied the phenotype and function of tumor-infiltrating Treg '
             'cells in ovarian cancer and melanoma to identify potential Treg '
             'cell-associated molecules that can be targeted by tumor '
             'immunotherapies. Experimental Design: The phenotype of '
             'intratumoral and circulating Treg cells was analyzed by '
             'multicolor flow cytometry, mass cytometry, RNA-Seq and '
             'functional assays. Results: Treg cells isolated from ovarian '
             'tumors displayed a distinct cell surface phenotype with '
             'increased expression of a number of receptors associated with '
             'TCR engagement, including PD‑1, 4-1BB and ICOS. Higher PD-1 and '
             '4-1BB expression was associated with increased responsiveness to '
             'further TCR stimulation and increased suppressive capacity, '
             'respectively. Transcriptomic and mass cytometry analyses '
             'revealed the presence of Treg cell subpopulations and further '
             'supported a highly activated state specifically in ovarian '
             'tumors. In comparison, Treg cells infiltrating melanomas '
             'displayed lower FOXP3, PD-1, 4-1BB and ICOS expression and were '
             'less potent suppressors of CD8 T cell proliferation. '
             'Conclusions: The highly activated phenotype of ovarian '
             'tumor-infiltrating Treg cells may be a key component of an '

{'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe prognosis of patients with recurrent World '
             'Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma is dismal, '
             'and there is currently no effective therapy. We conducted a '
             'dose-finding and toxicity study in this population of patients, '
             'evaluating convection-enhanced, intratumoral delivery of the '
             'recombinant nonpathogenic polio–rhinovirus chimera (PVSRIPO). '
             'PVSRIPO recognizes the poliovirus receptor CD155, which is '
             'widely expressed in neoplastic cells of solid tumors and in '
             'major components of the tumor microenvironment.MethodsWe '
             'enrolled consecutive adult patients who had recurrent '
             'supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma, confirmed on '
             'histopathological testing, with measurable disease '
             '(contrast-enhancing tumor of ≥1 cm and ≤5.5 cm in the greatest '
             'dimension). The study evaluated seven doses, ranging between 107 '
             'and 1010 50% tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50), first in '
             'a dose-escalation phase and then in a dose-expansion '
             'phase.ResultsFrom May 2012 through May 2017, a total of 61 '
             'patients were enrolled and received a dose of PVSRIPO. Dose '
             'level −1 (5.0×107 TCID50) was identified as the phase 2 dose. '
             'One dose-limiting toxic effect was observed; a patient in whom '
             'dose level 5 (1010 TCID50) was administered had a grade 4 '
             'intracranial hemorrhage immediately after the catheter was '
             'removed. To mitigate locoregional inflammation of the infused '
             'tumor with prolonged glucocorticoid use, dose level 5 was '
             'deescalated to reach the phase 2 dose. In the dose-expansion '
             'phase, 19% of the patients had a PVSRIPO-related adverse event '
             'of grade 3 or higher. Overall survival among the patients who '
             'received PVSRIPO reached a plateau of 21% (95% confidence '

             '[NCT00375674][1]). The 16-gene Recurrence Score (RS) assay was '
             'previously developed and validated to estimate risk for disease '

             'analysis was prospectively designed with prespecified genes, '
             'algorithm, endpoints, and analytical methods. Primary RCC was '
             'available from 212 patients with informed consent; primary '
             'analysis focused on patients with T3 RCC. Gene expression was '
             'quantitated by RT-PCR. Time to recurrence (TTR), DFS, and renal '

{'abstract': 'Combination therapy is a major strategy to circumvent the onset '
             'of treatment resistance in cancer patients; knowing which drugs '

             'combination treatments and refined the drug dosages in mouse '
             'models and ex vivo patient samples. Their platform requires no '
             'knowledge of which pathways to target and could more broadly aid '
             'drug repurposing efforts.  Multiple myeloma is an incurable '
             'hematological malignancy that relies on drug combinations for '
             'first and secondary lines of treatment. The inclusion of '
             'proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, into these '
             'combination regimens has improved median survival. Resistance to '
             'bortezomib, however, is a common occurrence that ultimately '
             'contributes to treatment failure, and there remains a need to '
             'identify improved drug combinations. We developed the quadratic '
             'phenotypic optimization platform (QPOP) to optimize treatment '
             'combinations selected from a candidate pool of 114 approved '
             'drugs. QPOP uses quadratic surfaces to model the biological '
             'effects of drug combinations to identify effective drug '
             'combinations without reference to molecular mechanisms or '
             'predetermined drug synergy data. Applying QPOP to '
             'bortezomib-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines determined the '
             'drug combinations that collectively optimized treatment '
             'efficacy. We found that these combinations acted by reversing '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Peritoneal carcinomatosis is common in advanced tumor '
             'stages or disease recurrence arising from gastrointestinal '
             'cancers, gynecologic malignancies, or primary peritoneal '
             'carcinoma. Because current therapies are mostly ineffective, new '
             'therapeutic approaches are needed. Here, we report on a phase I '
             'study designed to assess safety, MTD, and antitumor activity of '
             'intraperitoneal administration of oncolytic vaccinia virus '
             'GL-ONC1 in advanced stage peritoneal carcinomatosis patients.  '
             'Experimental Design: GL-ONC1 was administered intraperitoneally '
             'every 4 weeks for up to four cycles at three different dose '
             'levels (107–109 pfu) following a standard 3+3 dose escalation '
             'design. GL-ONC1 was infused via an indwelling catheter that '
             'enabled repetitive analyses of peritoneal fluid biopsies. The '
             'primary study objective was safety of GL-ONC1 according to '
             'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 '
             '(CTCAEv4.0).  Results: Patients with advanced-stage peritoneal '
             'carcinomatosis ( n = 7) or advanced peritoneal mesothelioma ( n '
             '= 2) received 24 doses of GL-ONC1. Adverse events were limited '
             'to grades 1–3, including transient flu-like symptoms and '
             'increased abdominal pain, resulting from treatment-induced '
             'peritonitis. No DLT was reported, and the MTD was not reached. '
             'Furthermore, no signs of viral shedding were observed. '
             'Importantly, in 8 of 9 study patients, effective intraperitoneal '
             'infections, in-patient replication of GL-ONC1, and subsequent '
             'oncolysis were demonstrated in cycle 1. All patients developed '
             'neutralizing activities against GL-ONC1.  Conclusions: GL-ONC1 '

{'abstract': 'Background:Since healing of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) '
             'grafts occurs by formation of a fibrovascular scar-tissue '
             'interface rather than by reformation of the native '
             'fibrocartilage transition zone, the purpose of our study was to '
             'examine expression of various signaling molecules and '
             'transcription factors that are known to be involved in '
             'embryologic insertion-site development following ACL '

             'ACL reconstruction to allow future study of the molecular '
             'mechanisms of healing.Methods:Seventy-nine mice underwent '
             'reconstruction of the ACL with autograft. Healing was assessed '
             'using histology in 12 mice and quantitative real-time polymerase '

             'obtain baseline data for the native ACL.Results:Histological '
             'analysis demonstrated healing by formation of fibrovascular '
             'tissue at the tendon-bone interface. Immunohistochemical '
             'analysis showed a positive expression of proteins in the Indian '
             'hedgehog, Wnt, and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) '
             'pathways. There was minimal Sox-9 expression. Gene-expression '
             'analysis showed an initial increase in markers of tissue repair '
             'and turnover, followed by a subsequent decline. Mean failure '
             'force and stiffness of the native ACL were 5.60 N and 3.44 N/mm, '

{'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundOxidative stress contributes to the complex '

             'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides in sickle cell erythrocytes, '
             'which probably reduces oxidative stress and could result in '

             'multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase '
             '3 trial, we tested the efficacy of pharmaceutical-grade '
             'l-glutamine (0.3 g per kilogram of body weight per dose) '
             'administered twice daily by mouth, as compared with placebo, in '

             'receiving hydroxyurea at a dose that had been stable for at '
             'least 3 months before screening continued that therapy through '
             'the 48-week treatment period.ResultsA total of 230 patients (age '

             '2:1 ratio, to receive l-glutamine (152 patients) or placebo (78 '
             'patients). The patients in the l-glutamine group had '
             'significantly fewer pain crises than those in the placebo group '
             '(P=0.005), with a median of 3.0 in the l-glutamine group and 4.0 '

             'median of 2.0 in the l-glutamine group and 3.0 in the placebo '

{'abstract': 'Background Achalasia is an uncommon condition characterised by '

             'its incidence, prevalence, disease associations and long-term '
             'outcomes are very limited.  Methods Hospital Episode Statistics '
             '(HES) include demographic and diagnostic data for all English '
             'hospital attendances. The Health Improvement Network (THIN) '
             'includes the primary care records of 4.5\u2009million UK '
             'subjects, representative of national demographics. Both were '
             'searched for incident cases between 2006 and 2016 and THIN for '
             'prevalent cases. Subjects with achalasia in THIN were compared '
             'with age, sex, deprivation tand smoking status matched controls '
             'for important comorbidities and mortality.  Results There were '
             '10\u2009509 and 711 new achalasia diagnoses identified in HES '
             'and THIN, respectively. The mean incidence per 100\u2009000 '
             'people in HES was 1.99 (95% CI 1.87 to 2.11) and 1.53 (1.42 to '
             '1.64) per 100\u2009000 person-years in THIN. The prevalence in '
             'THIN was 27.1 (25.4 to 28.9) per 100\u2009000 population. '
             'Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were significantly higher in '
             'subjects with achalasia (n=2369) compared with controls (n=3865) '

             'FFR of more than 0.80 received medical therapy and were entered '
             'into a registry. The primary end point was a composite of death, '
             'myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization.ResultsA '
             'total of 888 patients underwent randomization (447 patients in '

             'P<0.001). The difference was driven by urgent '
             'revascularizations, which occurred in 6.3% of the patients in '
             'the PCI group as compared with 21.1% of those in the '

             '[eaan5835][1]  ### BACKGROUND  The defining feature of '
             'eukaryotic cells is the presence of membrane-bound organelles of '
             'diverse kinds, each with specialized functions. Most organelles '
             'have multiple copies in cells. By contrast, each cell contains '
             'only one endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the ER consists of '
             'an elaborate network of membrane cisternae and tubules that '
             'extends throughout the cell and occupies a large fraction of the '
             'cytoplasmic volume. Though compartmentalization of biochemical '
             'reactions and processes in these organelles has obvious '
             'advantages, it also poses challenges for their coordinated '
             'activity, requiring mechanisms for regulated interorganelle '
             'communication. However, these mechanisms have remained elusive, '
             'and the quintessential textbook diagram still pictures '
             'organelles in isolation, floating in a cytoplasmic sea. The last '
             'decade has radically changed this view, and membrane contact '
             'sites (MCSs) between different organelles have been brought to '
             'center stage as prime, highly regulated routes for '
             'interorganelle communication essential for cell homeostasis.  '
             '### ADVANCES  The presence of organelle contacts was recognized '
             'long ago. However, the functions of these structures remained '
             'unclear. Recent advances in the resolution of microscopy and the '
             'development of unique fluorophores have markedly advanced our '
             'ability to study interorganelle MCSs. The three-dimensional '
             'structure of ER MCSs with other organelles and the plasma '
             'membrane (PM) can be visualized at nanometer resolution by '
             'electron microscopy (EM). Multispectral live-cell fluorescence '
             'microscopy displays the behavior of MCSs over time and in '
             'response to stimuli. Together, these data have revealed the '
             'general features of MCSs. For example, EM has revealed that MCSs '
             'are closely opposed and tethered but not fused membranes, MCSs '
             'are spaced at 10 to 30 nm, and ribosomes are excluded from the '
             'ER surface at these sites. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrates '
             'that organelles can remain attached to ER tubules as they '
             'traffic along microtubules. The combinations of these tools with '
             'classical molecular biology and biochemical tools have '
             'identified molecules implicated in several MCSs and elucidated '
             'their functions, including lipid and ion transport between '
             'organelles and organelle positioning and division.  ### OUTLOOK  '
             'MCSs are central to normal cell physiology. Moreover, several '
             'MCS proteins are linked to various diseases: seipin, protrudin, '
             'and spastin to hereditary spastic paraplegia; VAPA and VAPB to '
             'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Dnm2 and Mfn2 to '
             'Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; STIM1 and Orai1 to tubular '
             'aggregate myopathy; and ACBD5 to retinal dystrophy. Whether '
             'defects in MCS functions cause these diseases directly or '
             'indirectly remains to be explored. Recent progress has begun to '
             'identify some of the molecular machineries that regulate MCS '
             'formation. Dissecting the roles of these factors will strengthen '
             'our understanding of the integrative nature of MCSs. The '
             'advancement of diverse microscopy techniques will allow us to '
             'track multiple factors at MCSs simultaneously in real time and '
             'at high resolution, and this may help us gain a more detailed '
             'view of the biology of MCSs and their related physiological '
             'processes.  ![Figure][2]  ER MCSs with other organelles and the '
             'PM. The ER forms MCSs with mitochondria, Golgi, endosomes, '
             'peroxisomes, lipid droplets, and the PM. These MCSs are closely '
             'opposed but not fused membranes containing various molecular '
             'machineries. Factors localized to these MCSs mediate essential '
             'cellular processes, including lipid and ion exchange, organelle '
             'positioning, and biogenesis.    Our textbook image of organelles '
             'has changed. Instead of revealing isolated cellular '
             'compartments, the picture now emerging shows organelles as '
             'largely interdependent structures that can communicate through '
             'membrane contact sites (MCSs). MCSs are sites where opposing '
             'organelles are tethered but do not fuse. MCSs provide a hybrid '
             'location where the tool kits of two different organelles can '
             'work together to perform vital cellular functions, such as lipid '
             'and ion transfer, signaling, and organelle division. Here, we '
             'focus on MCSs involving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), an '
             'organelle forming an extensive network of cisternae and tubules. '
             'We highlight how the dynamic ER network regulates a plethora of '
             'cellular processes through MCSs with various organelles and with '
             'the plasma membrane.   [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aan5835  '

             'transplantation of a large femoral osteochondral allograft. The '

             'criterion for donor-graft acceptance. We hypothesized that there '
             'would be a linear correlation between the ROC and APL of a '
             'condyle, that the ROC and APL would differ significantly between '
             'the medial femoral condyle (MFC) and the lateral femoral condyle '
             '(LFC), and that a donor graft from the LFC would be suitable for '

             '147 patients with no cartilage defects were analyzed. Best-fit '
             'circles in the sagittal plane were determined at standardized '

             'differences in the ROC.Results:There was a linear correlation '
             'between the ROC and APL. There were significant differences in '
             'the mean ROC and APL between the MFC and LFC. Based on '

             'dromedaries develop only very mild infections and exceptionally '
             'potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses. These strong '
             'antibody responses may be caused by affinity maturation as a '
             'result of repeated exposure to the virus or by the fact that '
             'dromedaries—apart from conventional antibodies—have relatively '
             'unique, heavy chain–only antibodies (HCAbs). These HCAbs are '
             'devoid of light chains and have long complementarity-determining '
             'regions with unique epitope binding properties, allowing them to '
             'recognize and bind with high affinity to epitopes not recognized '
             'by conventional antibodies. Through direct cloning and '
             'expression of the variable heavy chains (VHHs) of HCAbs from the '
             'bone marrow of MERS-CoV–infected dromedaries, we identified '

             'affinity to the receptor binding domain of the viral spike '
             'protein. Furthermore, camel/human chimeric HCAbs—composed of the '
             'camel VHH linked to a human Fc domain lacking the CH1 exon—had '
             'an extended half-life in the serum and protected mice against a '

{'abstract': 'Background:Recurrent anterior instability following a failed '
             'Bankart repair in the shoulder represents a challenging clinical '
             'scenario. Few studies have examined the role of arthroscopic '
             'revision anterior stabilization as a treatment option in these '
             'cases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of '
             'arthroscopic revision anterior stabilization for patients with '
             'recurrent instability after a failed index '
             'procedure.Methods:Ninety-two patients underwent arthroscopic '
             'revision anterior stabilization after a failed index (open or '
             'arthroscopic) stabilization procedure. Sixty-five patients with '
             'a minimum of 2 years of follow-up were included in this study. '
             'The mean age at the time of revision surgery was 26 years '
             '(range, 15 to 57 years). The rate of recurrent instability and '
             'risk factors for failure were evaluated; the mean duration of '
             'follow-up was 4.7 years (range, 2 to 10.8 years). Glenoid and '
             'humeral bone loss were quantitatively assessed using '
             'preoperative T1-weighted magnetic resonance arthrograms to '
             'determine if the lesions were on-track or '
             'off-track.Results:Twenty-seven (42%) of the patients experienced '
             'recurrent instability at a mean of 2.3 years after arthroscopic '
             'revision anterior stabilization. On multivariate analysis, the '
             'presence of an off-track lesion, an age of &lt;22 years, and '
             'ligamentous laxity were independent predictors of recurrence (p '
             '= 0.022, 0.028, and 0.031, respectively). Among a cohort with '
             'these risk factors excluded, the failure rate was '
             '19%.Conclusions:Arthroscopic revision anterior stabilization is '
             'associated with a high rate of recurrent instability, and '

             '(glycogene)-derived molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer '
             'associated with patient outcomes.  Experimental Design: '
             'Transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets of nontumor, '
             'precancerous, cancerous tissues, and cell lines with somatic '
             'mutations, mismatch repair status, clinicopathologic and '
             'survival information were assembled ( n = 4,223) and glycogene '
             'profiles were analyzed. IHC for a glycogene, GALNT6, was '
             'conducted in adenoma and carcinoma specimens ( n = 403). The '
             'functional role and cell surface glycan profiles were further '
             'investigated by in vitro loss-of-function assays and lectin '
             'microarray analysis.  Results: We initially developed and '
             'validated a 15-glycogene signature that can identify a '
             'poor-prognostic subtype, which closely related to deficient '
             'mismatch repair (dMMR) and GALNT6 downregulation. The '
             'association of decreased GALNT6 with dMMR was confirmed in '
             'multiple datasets of tumors and cell lines, and was further '
             'recapitulated by IHC, where approximately 15% tumors exhibited '
             'loss of GALNT6 protein. GALNT6 mRNA and protein was expressed in '
             'premalignant/preinvasive lesions but was subsequently '
             'downregulated in a subset of carcinomas, possibly through '
             'epigenetic silencing. Decreased GALNT6 was independently '
             'associated with poor prognosis in the IHC cohort and an '
             'additional microarray meta-cohort, by multivariate analyses, and '
             'its discriminative power of survival was particularly remarkable '
             'in stage III patients. GALNT6 silencing in SW480 cells promoted '
             'invasion, migration, chemoresistance, and increased cell surface '
             'expression of a cancer-associated truncated O-glycan, '
             'Tn-antigen.  Conclusions: The 15-glycogene signature and the '
             'expression levels of GALNT6 mRNA and protein each serve as a '
             'novel prognostic biomarker, highlighting the role of '

             'infection and for whom the treating physician was uncertain '
             'whether antibiotic therapy was indicated to one of two groups: '
             'the procalcitonin group, in which the treating clinicians were '
             'provided with real-time initial (and serial, if the patient was '

             'that within 30 days after enrollment the total antibiotic-days '
             'would be lower — and the percentage of patients with adverse '
             'outcomes would not be more than 4.5 percentage points higher — '
             'in the procalcitonin group than in the usual-care group.ResultsA '
             'total of 1656 patients were included in the final analysis '
             'cohort (826 randomly assigned to the procalcitonin group and 830 '
             'to the usual-care group), of whom 782 (47.2%) were hospitalized '
             'and 984 (59.4%) received antibiotics within 30 days. The '
             'treating clinician received procalcitonin assay results for 792 '
             'of 826 patients (95.9%) in the procalcitonin group (median time '
             'from sample collection to assay result, 77 minutes) and for 18 '
             'of 830 patients (2.2%) in the usual-care group. In both groups, '
             'the procalcitonin-level tier was associated with the decision to '

{'abstract': 'The microbiome has received increasing attention over the last '

{'abstract': 'Under natural conditions, bacteria form mixed, interacting '

             'Goldford et al. sampled the microbial communities from soil and '

             'conditions converged reproducibly to reflect the experimentally '
             'imposed conditions rather than the mix of species initially '

             'patterns persisted.  Science , this issue p. [469][1]  A major '
             'unresolved question in microbiome research is whether the '
             'complex taxonomic architectures observed in surveys of natural '
             'communities can be explained and predicted by fundamental, '
             'quantitative principles. Bridging theory and experiment is '
             'hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that '
             'simultaneously affect community assembly in natural ecosystems. '
             'We addressed this challenge by monitoring the assembly of '

             'single tertiary care academic institution, 77 patients (77 TKAs) '
             'underwent reconstruction with use of Marlex mesh for an extensor '
             'mechanism disruption (27 quadriceps tendon disruptions, 40 '
             'patellar tendon disruptions, and 10 patellar fractures). The '
             'mean patient age at the time of reconstruction was 65 years; 70% '
             'of the patients were female. The mean body mass index was 35 '
             'kg/m2. The mean follow-up was 4 years. Eighteen (23%) of the '
             'patients underwent mesh reconstruction with the primary TKA in '
             'place, and 59 (77%) had mesh reconstruction at the time of '
             'revision TKA. The mean time between disruption and '
             'reconstruction was 7 months. Twenty (26%) of the patients had '
             'previously undergone attempted extensor mechanism reconstruction '
             'at outside institutions.Results:Sixty-five of the 77 mesh '
             'reconstructions were in place at the time of the latest '
             'follow-up. Twelve patients experienced a failure that required '
             'mesh revision: 5 for patellar tendon rupture, 5 for quadriceps '
             'tendon rupture, and 2 for symptomatic lengthening. Four '
             'additional patients with mesh failure were treated '
             'nonoperatively with bracing. The 2-year survivorship free of '
             'mesh revision was 86% for patients with no prior reconstruction '
             'and 95% for patients with previous reconstructions of the '
             'extensor mechanism that did not involve Marlex mesh. Knee '
             'Society Score (KSS) results significantly improved following '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: The clinical success of targeted therapies such as '
             'cetuximab and radiotherapy (RT) is hampered by the low response '

             'study, we investigated the involvement of EphB4–ephrin-B2 '
             'protumorigenic signaling in mediating resistance to EGFR '
             'inhibition and RT in head and neck cancers.  Experimental '
             'Design: We used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of head '
             'and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and HNSCC cell lines to '
             'test our hypothesis. Tumor tissues were subjected to PhosphoRTK '
             'array, and Western blotting to detect changes in EphB4–ephrin-B2 '
             'targets. mRNA sequencing and microarray data analysis were '
             'performed on PDX tumors and HNSCC cell lines, respectively, to '
             'determine differences in gene expression of molecules involved '
             'in tumor cell growth, proliferation, and survival pathways. '
             'Effects on cell growth were determined by MTT assay on HNSCC '
             'cells downregulated for EphB4/ephrin-B2 expression, with and '

             'locally advanced HNSCC patients treated with standard-of-care '
             'definitive chemo-RT show elevated EphB4 and ephrin-B2 levels '
             'after failure of treatment. We observed significant response '
             'toward cetuximab and RT following EphB4–ephrin-B2 inhibition, '
             'resulting in improved survival in tumor-bearing mice. Tumor '
             'growth inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of '
             'proliferation and prosurvival molecules and increased '

             'of adopting rational drug combinations to enhance therapeutic '

             'cetuximab-RT with EphB4–ephrin-B2 blockade has the potential to '

{'abstract': 'Objective In anti-citrullinated protein antibody positive '
             'rheumatoid arthritis (ACPA-positive RA), a particular subset of '
             'HLA-DRB1 alleles, called shared epitope (SE) alleles, is a '
             'highly influential genetic risk factor. Here, we investigated '
             'whether non- HLA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), '
             'conferring low disease risk on their own, interact with SE '
             'alleles more frequently than expected by chance and if such '
             'genetic interactions influence the HLA-DRB1 SE effect concerning '
             'risk to ACPA-positive RA.  Methods We computed the attributable '
             'proportion (AP) due to additive interaction at genome-wide level '
             'for two independent ACPA-positive RA cohorts: the Swedish '
             'epidemiological investigation of rheumatoid arthritis (EIRA) and '
             'the North American rheumatoid arthritis consortium (NARAC). '
             'Then, we tested for differences in the AP p value distributions '
             'observed for two groups of SNPs, non-associated and associated '
             'with disease. We also evaluated whether the SNPs in interaction '
             'with HLA-DRB1 were cis-eQTLs in the SE alleles context in '
             'peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with '
             'ACPA-positive RA (SE-eQTLs).  Results We found a strong '
             'enrichment of significant interactions (AP p<0.05) between the '
             'HLA-DRB1 SE alleles and the group of SNPs associated with '
             'ACPA-positive RA in both cohorts (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test D=0.35 '
             'for EIRA and D=0.25 for NARAC, p<2.2e-16 for both). '
             'Interestingly, 564 out of 1492 SNPs in consistent interaction '
             'for both cohorts were significant SE-eQTLs. Finally, we observed '
             'that the effect size of HLA-DRB1 SE alleles for disease '

             'pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile that may help '
             'prevent angioedema attacks.MethodsIn this international, '
             'three-part, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated '
             'four doses of BCX7353 (62.5 mg, 125 mg, 250 mg, and 350 mg once '
             'daily) for the prevention of angioedema attacks over a 28-day '
             'period. Patients with type I or II hereditary angioedema with a '
             'history of at least two angioedema attacks per month were '
             'randomly assigned to BCX7353 or placebo. The primary efficacy '

{'abstract': 'Objective Although anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) '
             'therapies represent a major breakthrough in IBD therapy, their '
             'cost–benefit ratio is hampered by an overall 30% non-response '
             'rate, adverse side effects and high costs. Thus, finding '
             'predictive biomarkers of non-response prior to commencing '
             'anti-TNFα therapy is of high value.  Design We analysed publicly '
             'available whole-genome expression profiles of colon biopsies '
             'obtained from multiple cohorts of patients with IBD using a '
             'combined computational deconvolution—meta-analysis paradigm '

             'measured expression and capture differential regulatory '
             'programmes otherwise masked due to variation in cellular '
             'composition. Insights from this in silico approach were '
             'experimentally validated in biopsies and blood samples of three '
             'independent test cohorts.  Results We found the proportion of '
             'plasma cells as a robust pretreatment biomarker of non-response '
             'to therapy, which we validated in two independent cohorts of '
             'immune-stained colon biopsies, where a plasma cellular score '
             'from inflamed biopsies was predictive of non-response with an '
             'area under the curve (AUC) of 82%. Meta-analysis of the cell '
             'proportion-adjusted gene expression data suggested that an '
             'increase in inflammatory macrophages in anti-TNFα non-responding '
             'individuals is associated with the upregulation of the '
             'triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) and '

             'identified TREM-1 downregulation in non-responders at baseline, '
             'which was predictive of response with an AUC of 94%.  '
             'Conclusions Our study proposes two clinically feasible assays, '
             'one in biopsy and one in blood, for predicting non-response to '
             'anti-TNFα therapy prior to initiation of treatment. Moreover, it '

             'hundred and two patients (66 male patients and 36 female '
             'patients, with a median age of 62 years) underwent rib fracture '
             'fixation during the study period. The causes of trauma were road '

{'abstract': 'Leadership of groups is of paramount importance and pervades '
             'almost every aspect of society. Leadership research has rarely '
             'used computational modeling or neuroimaging techniques to '
             'examine mechanistic or neurobiological underpinnings of '
             'leadership choices. Edelson et al. found empirically and '
             'theoretically that the choice to lead rests on a metacognitive '
             'process (see the Perspective by Fleming and Bang). Individuals '
             'who showed less “responsibility aversion” had higher leadership '
             'scores. A computational model combining signal detection theory '
             'with prospect theory provided a mechanistic understanding of '
             'this preference. Neuroimaging experiments showed how the key '
             'theoretical concepts are encoded in the activity and '
             'connectivity of a brain network that comprises the medial '
             'prefrontal cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, the temporal '
             'parietal junction, and the anterior insula.  Science , this '
             'issue p. [467][1]; see also p. [eaat0036][2]  ### INTRODUCTION  '
             'Decisions as diverse as committing soldiers to the battlefield '
             'or picking a school for your child share a basic attribute: '
             'assuming responsibility for the outcome of others. This '
             'responsibility is inherent in the roles of prime ministers and '
             'generals, as well as in the more quotidian roles of firm '
             'managers, schoolteachers, and parents. Here we identify the '
             'underlying behavioral, computational, and neurobiological '
             'mechanisms that determine the choice to assume responsibility '
             'over others.  ### METHODS  We developed a decision paradigm in '
             'which an individual can delegate decision-making power about a '
             'choice between a risky and a safe option to their group or keep '
             'the right to decide: In the “self” trials, only the individual’s '
             'payoff is at stake, whereas in the “group” trials, each group '
             'member’s payoff is affected. We combined models from perceptual '
             'and value-based decision-making to es\xadtimate each '
             'individual’s personal utility for every available action in '
             'order to tease apart potential motivations for choosing to '
             '“lead” or “follow.” We also used brain imaging to examine the '
             'neurobiological basis of leadership choices.  ### RESULTS  The '
             'large majority of the subjects display responsibility aversion '
             '(see figure, left panel), that is, their willingness to choose '
             'between the risky and the safe option is lower in the group '
             'trials relative to the self trials, independent of basic '
             'preferences toward risk, losses, ambiguity, social preferences, '
             'or intrinsic valuations of decision rights. Furthermore, our '
             'findings indicate that responsibility aversion is not associated '
             'with the overall frequency of keeping or delegating '
             'decision-making power. Rather, responsibility aversion is driven '
             'by a second-order cognitive process reflecting an increase in '
             'the demand for certainty about what constitutes the best choice '
             'when others’ welfare is affected. Individuals who are less '
             'responsibility averse have higher questionnaire-based and '
             'real-life leadership scores. The center panel of the figure '
             'shows the correlation between predicted and observed leadership '
             'scores in a new, independent sample. Our analyses of the dynamic '
             'interactions between brain regions demonstrate the importance of '
             'information flow between brain regions involved in computing '
             'separate components of the choice to understanding leadership '
             'decisions and individual differences in responsibility '
             'aversion.  ### DISCUSSION  The driving forces behind people’s '
             'choices to lead or follow are very important but largely '
             'unknown. We identify responsibility aversion as a key '
             'determinant of the willingness to lead. Moreover, it is '
             'predictive of both survey-based and real-life leadership scores. '
             'These results sug\xadgest that many people associate a '
             'psychological cost with assuming responsibility for others’ '
             'outcomes. Individual differences in the perception of, and '
             'willingness to bear, responsibility as the price of leadership '
             'may determine who will strive toward leadership roles and, '
             'moreover, are associated with how well they perform as leaders.  '
             'Our computational model provides a conceptual framework for the '
             'decision to assume responsibility for others’ outcomes as well '
             'as insights into the cognitive and neural mechanisms driving '
             'this choice process. This framework applies to many different '
             'leadership types, including authoritarian leaders, who make most '
             'decisions themselves, and egalitarian leaders, who frequently '
             'seek a group consensus. We believe that such a theoretical '
             'foundation is critical for a precise understanding of the nature '
             'and consequences of leadership.  ![Figure][3]  Frequency, '
             'out-of-sample predictive power, and computational foundations of '
             'responsibility aversion. (Left) Responsibility aversion differs '
             'widely across individuals. (Center) These individual differences '
             'in responsibility aversion can be used to predict leadership '
             'scores in a new, independent sample. (Right) The '
             'lead-versus-defer decision process is illustrated. The black '
             'curve shows the proportion of defer choices increasing when the '
             'subjective-value difference between actions approaches zero '
             '(dashed line). This pattern holds in both self and group trials. '
             'What changes is where people set deferral thresholds (orange, '
             'self; blue, group), which determine when they are most likely to '
             'defer. More responsibility-averse individuals show a larger '
             'shift in the deferral thresholds, which our computational model '
             'links to increased demand for certainty about the best course of '
             'action when faced with assuming responsibility for others. r , '
             'Spearman rank correlation coefficient.    Leaders must take '
             'responsibility for others and thus affect the well-being of '
             'individuals, organizations, and nations. We identify the effects '
             'of responsibility on leaders’ choices at the behavioral and '
             'neurobiological levels and document the widespread existence of '
             'responsibility aversion, that is, a reduced willingness to make '
             'decisions if the welfare of others is at stake. In mechanistic '
             'terms, basic preferences toward risk, loss, and ambiguity do not '
             'explain responsibility aversion, which, instead, is driven by a '
             'second-order cognitive process reflecting an increased demand '
             'for certainty about the best choice when others’ welfare is '
             'affected. Finally, models estimating levels of information flow '
             'between brain regions that process separate choice components '
             'provide the first step in understanding the neurobiological '
             'basis of individual variability in responsibility aversion and '

{'abstract': 'Obesity increases the risk of vascular diseases, including '
             'aortic aneurysm (AA). Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) '
             'surrounding arteries are altered during obesity. However, the '
             'underlying mechanism of adipose tissue, especially PVAT, in the '
             'pathogenesis of AA is still unclear. Here we showed that '

             'formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 31 confirmed '
             'patients with neuroblastoma was detected by locked nucleic acid- '
             'in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR. The correlation between '
             'miR-221 expression and clinical features in patients with '
             'neuroblastoma was assessed. The mechanisms as to how miR-221 '
             'regulate MYCN in neuroblastoma were addressed. The effect of '
             'miR-221 on cellular proliferation in neuroblastoma was '
             'determined both in vitro and in vivo .  Results: miR-221 was '
             'significantly upregulated in neuroblastoma tumor cells and '
             'tissues that overexpress MYCN, and high expression of miR-221 '
             'was positively associated with poor survival in patients with '
             'neuroblastoma. Nemo-like kinase (NLK) as a direct target of '
             'miR-221 in neuroblastoma was verified. In addition, '
             'overexpression of miR-221 decreased LEF1 phosphorylation but '
             'increased the expression of MYCN via targeting of NLK and '
             'further regulated cell cycle, particularly in S-phase, promoting '
             'the growth of neuroblastoma cells.  Conclusions: This study '
             'provides a novel insight for miR-221 in the control of '
             'neuroblastoma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, suggesting '
             'potentials of miR-221 as a prognosis marker and therapeutic '

{'abstract': 'Abstract  BackgroundIn efficacy trials of a tetravalent dengue '
             'vaccine (CYD-TDV), excess hospitalizations for dengue were '
             'observed among vaccine recipients 2 to 5 years of age. Precise '
             'risk estimates according to observed dengue serostatus could not '
             'be ascertained because of the limited numbers of samples '
             'collected at baseline. We developed a dengue anti–nonstructural '
             'protein 1 (NS1) IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and used '
             'samples from month 13 to infer serostatus for a post hoc '
             'analysis of safety and efficacy. MethodsIn a case–cohort study, '
             'we reanalyzed data from three efficacy trials. For the principal '
             'analyses, we used baseline serostatus determined on the basis of '
             'measured (when baseline values were available) or imputed (when '
             'baseline values were missing) titers from a 50% plaque-reduction '
             'neutralization test (PRNT50), with imputation conducted with the '
             'use of covariates that included the month 13 anti-NS1 assay '
             'results. The risk of hospitalization for virologically confirmed '
             'dengue (VCD), of severe VCD, and of symptomatic VCD according to '
             'dengue serostatus was estimated by weighted Cox regression and '
             'targeted minimum loss–based estimation. ResultsAmong '
             'dengue-seronegative participants 2 to 16 years of age, the '
             'cumulative 5-year incidence of hospitalization for VCD was 3.06% '
             'among vaccine recipients and 1.87% among controls, with a hazard '
             'ratio (vaccine vs. control) through data cutoff of 1.75 (95% '
             'confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 2.70). Among '
             'dengue-seronegative participants 9 to 16 years of age, the '
             'cumulative incidence of hospitalization for VCD was 1.57% among '
             'vaccine recipients and 1.09% among controls, with a hazard ratio '
             'of 1.41 (95% CI, 0.74 to 2.68). Similar trends toward a higher '
             'risk among seronegative vaccine recipients than among '
             'seronegative controls were also found for severe VCD. Among '
             'dengue-seropositive participants 2 to 16 years of age and those '
             '9 to 16 years of age, the cumulative incidence of '
             'hospitalization for VCD was 0.75% and 0.38%, respectively, among '
             'vaccine recipients and 2.47% and 1.88% among controls, with '
             'hazard ratios of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.45) and 0.21 (95% CI, '
             '0.14 to 0.31). The risk of severe VCD was also lower among '
             'seropositive vaccine recipients than among seropositive '
             'controls. ConclusionsCYD-TDV protected against severe VCD and '
             'hospitalization for VCD for 5 years in persons who had exposure '
             'to dengue before vaccination, and there was evidence of a higher '

             'Science , this issue p. [eaar7042][1]   ### INTRODUCTION  '
             'Obtaining multiplexed molecular readouts from large numbers of '
             'single cells in situ is an important technological goal to '
             'facilitate scientific discoveries in basic and translational '
             'research. Various methods have been developed in recent years to '
             'achieve spatially resolved multiplexed measurements of the '
             'abundance of large sets of mRNAs or proteins in biological '
             'samples. These technologies have brought the promise that, '
             'through large-scale efforts, all functionally relevant cell '
             'types of an organism will emerge from such multiplexed data in '
             'an unbiased manner. Furthermore, these cell types will be able '
             'to be mapped within their physical context within a tissue.  ### '
             'RATIONALE  The involvement of an mRNA or protein (state) in '
             'cellular function depends on its specific intracellular location '
             'and interaction with other molecules and cellular structures. '
             'Moreover, the phenotype of an individual cell is determined by '
             'the functional state, abundance, morphology, and turnover of its '
             'organelles and cytoskeletal structures. To functionally '
             'interpret molecular multiplexed information, such measurements '
             'will thus need to resolve the intracellular length scale.  ### '
             'RESULTS  We report a simple, robust, and nondegrading protocol '
             'that achieves 40-plex protein staining in the same biological '
             'sample using off-the-shelf antibodies called iterative indirect '
             'immunofluorescence imaging (4i). In conjunction with '
             'high-throughput automated microscopy and computer vision, 4i '
             'allows highly reproducible multiplexed measurements from surface '
             'areas of several mm2 subsampled by pixels of 165 nm by 165 nm. '
             'This approach simultaneously captures functionally relevant '
             'properties that emerge at the cell population, cellular, and '
             'intracellular level. 4i can thus quantify the influence of local '
             'cell crowding on protein abundance, the effect of cell cycle '
             'position on protein phosphorylation, patterns of protein '
             'subcompartmentalization, and organelle morphology all in the '
             'same single cell and across thousands of cells.  We developed a '
             'data-driven computer vision approach that generates multiplexed '
             'protein maps (MPMs). MPMs comprehensively quantify intracellular '
             'protein composition with high spatial detail in large numbers of '
             'single cells. They are not confounded by the specific relative '
             'geometry and orientation of an individual cell. Thus, MPMs allow '
             'systematic comparisons of subcellular spatial protein '
             'distribution between single cells that experience different cell '
             'cycle states, microenvironments, growth conditions, or exposure '
             'to drugs. Using the example of subcellular relocalization of '
             'epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor upon exposure to EGF, we '
             'demonstrate that MPMs allow the systematic definition of '
             'cellular states undetectable by multiplexed whole-cell '
             'measurements. The findings are functionally relevant and can be '
             'connected to multiple molecular and phenotypic properties '
             'apparent at the cellular and cell population scale.  ### '
             'CONCLUSION  By preventing photocrosslinking during imaging, 4i '
             'enables multiplexed immunofluorescence with off-the-shelf '
             'antibodies, both in small-scale and high-throughput experiments. '
             '4i datasets cover multiple length scales, eliminating the need '
             'for extrapolation or inference in the interpretation of results. '
             'Integration of these length scales in one dataset reveals a '
             'richness of scale-crossing connections that current models of '
             'biological processes do not yet consider. These connections '
             'determine how gene expression is adapted to the cellular state, '
             'how a cell type is determined, how a pathological cellular '
             'phenotype emerges, or how a tumor cell responds to a drug.  '
             '![Figure][2]  Iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging '
             '(4i). 4i obtains 40-plexed protein readouts at high spatial '
             'detail in thousands of cells with the use of off-the-shelf '
             'antibodies. Multiplexed protein maps derived from such images '
             'provide a comprehensive quantitative description of '
             'compartmentalized intracellular protein composition. These maps '
             'can identify new cellular states and allow quantitative '
             'comparisons of intracellular organization between single cells '
             'in different cell cycle states, microenvironments, and drug '
             'treatments.    Obtaining highly multiplexed protein measurements '
             'across multiple length scales has enormous potential for '
             'biomedicine. Here, we measured, by iterative indirect '
             'immunofluorescence imaging (4i), 40-plex protein readouts from '
             'biological samples at high-throughput from the millimeter to the '
             'nanometer scale. This approach simultaneously captures '
             'properties apparent at the population, cellular, and subcellular '
             'levels, including microenvironment, cell shape, and cell cycle '
             'state. It also captures the detailed morphology of organelles, '
             'cytoskeletal structures, nuclear subcompartments, and the fate '
             'of signaling receptors in thousands of single cells in situ. We '
             'used computer vision and systems biology approaches to achieve '
             'unsupervised comprehensive quantification of protein '
             'subcompartmentalization within various multicellular, cellular, '
             'and pharmacological contexts. Thus, highly multiplexed '
             'subcellular protein maps can be used to identify functionally '
             'relevant single-cell states.   [1]: '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: The oncogenic miR-155 is upregulated in many human '
             'cancers, and its expression is increased in more aggressive and '
             'therapy-resistant tumors, but the molecular mechanisms '
             'underlying miR-155-induced therapy resistance are not fully '
             'understood. The main objectives of this study were to determine '
             'the role of miR-155 in resistance to chemotherapy and to '
             'evaluate anti-miR-155 treatment to chemosensitize tumors.  '
             'Experimental Design: We performed in vitro studies on cell lines '
             'to investigate the role of miR-155 in therapy resistance. To '
             'assess the effects of miR-155 inhibition on chemoresistance, we '
             'used an in vivo orthotopic lung cancer model of athymic nude '
             'mice, which we treated with anti-miR-155 alone or in combination '
             'with chemotherapy. To analyze the association of miR-155 '
             'expression and the combination of miR-155 and TP53 expression '
             'with cancer survival, we studied 956 patients with lung cancer, '
             'chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  '
             'Results: We demonstrate that miR-155 induces resistance to '
             'multiple chemotherapeutic agents in vitro , and that '
             'downregulation of miR-155 successfully resensitizes tumors to '
             'chemotherapy in vivo . We show that anti-miR-155-DOPC can be '
             'considered non-toxic in vivo . We further demonstrate that '
             'miR-155 and TP53 are linked in a negative feedback mechanism and '
             'that a combination of high expression of miR-155 and low '
             'expression of TP53 is significantly associated with shorter '
             'survival in lung cancer.  Conclusions: Our findings support the '
             'existence of an miR-155/TP53 feedback loop, which is involved in '
             'resistance to chemotherapy and which can be specifically '

             'mutation burden of the tumor is high and the disease risk is '
             'strongly associated with immunosuppression. In the '
             'dose-escalation portion of the phase 1 study of cemiplimab, a '
             'deep and durable response was observed in a patient with '
             'metastatic cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma.MethodsWe report '
             'the results of the phase 1 study of cemiplimab for expansion '
             'cohorts of patients with locally advanced or metastatic '
             'cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, as well as the results of the '
             'pivotal phase 2 study for a cohort of patients with metastatic '
             'disease (metastatic-disease cohort). In both studies, the '
             'patients received an intravenous dose of cemiplimab (3 mg per '
             'kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks and were assessed for a '
             'response every 8 weeks. In the phase 2 study, the primary end '
             'point was the response rate, as assessed by independent central '
             'review.ResultsIn the expansion cohorts of the phase 1 study, a '
             'response to cemiplimab was observed in 13 of 26 patients (50%; '
             '95% confidence interval [CI], 30 to 70). In the '
             'metastatic-disease cohort of the phase 2 study, a response was '
             'observed in 28 of 59 patients (47%; 95% CI, 34 to 61). The '
             'median follow-up was 7.9 months in the metastatic-disease cohort '
             'of the phase 2 study. Among the 28 patients who had a response, '
             'the duration of response exceeded 6 months in 57%, and 82% '
             'continued to have a response and to receive cemiplimab at the '

{'abstract': 'The sudden appearance of crop diseases can cause an irreparable '
             'economic shock, particularly to smallholder farmers in '
             'developing countries. Wheat blast, for example, is a devastating '
             'fungal disease from South America, which emerged in Bangladesh '
             'in 2016 ([ 1 ][1]). It is currently controlled by quarantine but '
             'could easily spread to other wheat-growing areas, which could '
             'threaten food security. Furthermore, widespread crop failure '
             'from stem rust has occurred in Kenya and Ethiopia. Recent '
             'advances could provide a solution to this problem through the '
             'rapid discovery and isolation of disease-resistance genes from '
             'wild relatives of wheat, followed by their introduction by '
             'transformation into the elite crop varieties. There is, however, '
             'a barrier to such progress: Wheat, a worldwide staple food, has '
             'become an orphan among genetically modified (GM) crops.  GM '
             'crops—mainly corn, cotton and soybean—that contain transgenes '
             'for herbicide tolerance and insect resistance have significantly '
             'increased profit margins for farmers ([ 2 ][2]). Although GM '
             'rice is not yet commercially grown, several traits have been '
             'approved, for example, insect resistance, herbicide tolerance, '
             'and biofortification with provitamin A ([ 3 ][3]). The only '
             'application for the approval of a GM trait in wheat, herbicide '
             'tolerance, was abandoned in 2004 in the United States, and, '
             'apparently, no other trait has since been submitted for '
             'regulatory approval ([ 3 ][3]). Transgenic introduction of a '
             'gene that conferred resistance against Fusarium , a fungus that '
             'kills the grain-bearing organ in wheat and contaminates '
             'remaining grain with toxins, was ostensibly successful ([ 4 '
             '][4]), but there is no record of an attempt to obtain approval '
             'for commercial planting of the GM crop. It appears that pressure '
             'from anti-GM consumer groups, mainly from Europe and Japan, on '
             'producers and unattractive profit margins for developers have '
             'relegated wheat to a low-priority crop. The agricultural seed '
             'industry charges a premium on GM seeds. Wheat is grown mostly on '
             'marginal land in the United States and generates only ∼20% of '
             'farm income compared with maize, making it questionable whether '
             'industry can recover the costs associated with research '
             'investment. If and when GM wheat becomes available, countries in '
             'Africa and Asia, where food security is a perpetual concern, '
             'might be receptive to GM wheat, provided its use helps to '
             'stabilize production.  ![Figure][5]  Introducing disease '
             'resistance to wheat Genetic diversity for disease resistance in '
             'wheat has been lost through bottlenecks imposed by '
             'polyploidization, domestication, and breeding. Resistance genes '
             'from wild relatives can be incorporated into elite cultivars by '
             'crossbreeding, which is accelerated by speed breeding, and speed '
             'cloning with genetic modification (GM).  GRAPHIC: ADAPTED BY A. '
             'KITTERMAN/ SCIENCE   Wheat is grown on more land area than any '
             'other cereal crop, and it is second only to maize in grain '
             'production (see fig. S1). On average, wheat provides ∼20% of the '
             'daily calories and protein per capita worldwide ([ 5 ][6]). With '
             'increasing global population and urbanization, demand for wheat '
             'is expected to increase, which will require an increase in the '
             'current rate of global yield gain of ∼1% per year ([ 5 ][6]) '
             '(see fig. S2). Current potential grain yield, which is the '
             'amount of grain produced under nonlimiting inputs in the absence '
             'of abiotic or biotic stresses, is reportedly ∼12 metric tons per '
             'hectare for wheat; however, the actual harvested yield is less '
             'than 4 metric tons per hectare ([ 6 ][7]). Suboptimal farm '
             'inputs, unpredictable environmental fluctuations, and diseases '
             'are some of the factors that suppress the yield potential. '
             'Genetic selection of stable varieties adapted to adverse '
             'climatic factors—for example, high temperature—is perhaps the '
             'most suitable avenue to mitigate the effects of unpredictable '
             'variables. However, changes in management practices and a '
             'readily available tool kit to guard against diseases are certain '
             'to help narrow the yield gap ([ 7 ][8]).  The ancestral '
             'hybridization events that gave rise to cultivated wheat, through '
             'polyploidization of the genome, followed by domestication and '
             'breeding, sampled only a fraction of the available genetic '
             'diversity, creating genetic bottlenecks at each stage (see the '
             'figure). This progressive narrowing of the genetic base resulted '
             'in a modern crop that is highly vulnerable to disease. The '
             'ability to incorporate disease resistance from breeding with '
             'exotic grass (wheat) species can compensate for this lack of '
             'genetic diversity. However, in practice, crossbreeding is a '
             'resource-intensive, time-consuming process because the '
             'generation time of wheat is 4 to 5 months. Speed breeding, which '
             'halves the generation time of wheat under artificial growth '
             'conditions ([ 8 ][9]), could allow a much faster incorporation '
             'of exotic resistance genes. However, limitations persist, '
             'including sexual incompatibility and linkage drag, the latter '
             'resulting from the co-introduction of linked, deleterious genes '
             'from the donor parent. Indeed, the potential of many exotic '
             'resistance genes is untapped owing to the burden of linkage '
             'drag. More importantly, when single resistance genes are '
             'deployed in a disease hot spot, they are often rapidly overcome '
             'by resistance-breaking strains of the pathogen, dissuading many '
             'breeders from undertaking this strategy. As a result, the '
             'genetic treasure trove for disease resistance in wild relatives '
             'of wheat remains a largely underutilized resource in wheat '
             'breeding.  If multiple disease-resistance genes from wild wheat '
             'relatives were cloned, these could be introduced as a multigene '
             'cassette by transformation into the wheat genome to provide '
             'broad-spectrum multilayered resistance that could delay the '
             'evolution of resistance-breaking pathogen strains ([ 9 ][10]). '
             'Such a cassette, or GM stack, would have the added benefit of '
             'being free from linkage drag. Moreover, unlike in the natural '
             'genetic makeup, in which the individual genes may be scattered '
             'throughout the genome, a cassette would ensure that the genes '
             'stay together in a breeding program, thus eliminating the risk '
             'of individual genes being separated from the stack and being '
             'overcome by the pathogen, causing piecemeal weakening of the '
             'stack and eventual breakdown.  Cloning disease-resistance genes '
             'from wild wheats, however, presents several challenges, '
             'including the complex, polygenic nature of durable disease '
             'resistance and seed and growth morphologies that are '
             'incompatible with existing mechanized cultivation. These issues '
             'conspire to limit the scope of traditional gene-cloning '
             'technologies, which require a disease-resistance gene to be '
             'genetically isolated in an otherwise susceptible background, '
             'followed by the generation and screening of large '
             'laboratory-produced populations ([ 10 ][11]). However, '
             'population genetics combined with next-generation sequencing is '
             'now reaching an inflection point at which it can deconvolute the '
             'complex relationship between genetic structure and phenotypes in '
             'a natural population to rapidly identify causal gene variants ([ '
             '11 ][12]). Therefore, by selectively sequencing the repertoire '
             'of immune receptors (which detect molecules expressed by '
             'pathogens) and correlating these genotypes with disease '
             'susceptibility across a population of wild wheats, it seems '
             'possible to rapidly discover and identify (clone) the underlying '
             'disease-resistance genes ([ 12 ][13]) (see the figure). These '
             'and other technologies are likely to fuel an exponential growth '
             'of cloned disease-resistance genes. Moreover, cereal '
             'transformation technologies have improved to the point where '
             'inserting large stacks directly into elite cultivars should not '
             'provide a technical barrier ([ 13 ][14]).  Is wheat ready to '
             'come of GM age? A compelling case concerns wheat blast, a '
             'destructive disease in Brazil and other countries of South '
             'America. In 2016, it appeared in Bangladesh, causing widespread '
             'devastation ([ 1 ][1]). This disease now threatens to undermine '
             "food security in South and Southeast Asia, the world's largest "
             'wheat belt, where 300 million undernourished people consume more '
             'than 100 million metric tons of wheat per year. Very little '
             'resistance to wheat blast has been reported in cultivated wheat '
             '([ 14 ][15]). However, genetic variation for resistance can be '
             'found in the goatgrass Aegilops tauschii , a wild progenitor of '
             'wheat ([ 15 ][16]).  A wheat blast–resistance gene stack would '
             'have an excellent chance of halting the spread of the pathogen '
             'in Southeast Asia owing to the extreme genetic bottleneck in the '
             'pathogen imposed by its single incursion from South America. '
             'Because the pathogen was likely imported through contaminated '
             'grain, a key to success will be to ensure that there are no '
             'further incursions leading to increased genetic diversity in the '
             'pathogen population. However, because the pathogens causing '
             'wheat and rice blast are genetically similar and are both known '
             'to occur on other grass hosts ([ 13 ][14]), there is a risk that '
             'they could recombine and give rise to virulent forms that would '
             'infect both rice and wheat, creating a continuous disease cycle, '
             'or “green bridge,” in the rice-wheat rotation cropping system '
             '(whereby growing these two crops is rotated in the same year) '
             'that is practiced across much of Bangladesh, northern India, and '
             'southern China. Therefore, it is important that further '
             'proliferation of the pathogen in the region is curbed as soon as '
             'possible by the introduction of resistant wheat varieties.  '
             'Southeast Asia undoubtedly needs a solution to wheat blast, but '
             'if a GM solution existed, would it be adopted? Bangladesh seems '
             'likely to take the first step. The country comprises a '
             'burgeoning population, supported by intensive agriculture with '
             'up to three crops per season. Its framework for deregulating GM '
             'crops is rapidly maturing. It recently approved GM eggplant with '
             'insect resistance, is in the process of deregulating GM potato '
             'with late-blight resistance, and is close to releasing golden '
             'rice fortified with provitamin A. Bangladesh must import wheat '
             'to meet national demand, so there is no risk of upsetting a '
             'national export market with GM wheat, which is banned in many '
             'countries. However, if wheat blast were to spread into the '
             'Punjab in northern India, then it could prove challenging to '
             'control stewardship of a GM blast-resistant wheat line used in '
             "this region, potentially affecting India's wheat export market.  "
             'Although the Bangladeshi Ministry of Agriculture supports GM '
             'crop cultivation, it may have to adopt other measures while the '
             'political and social stalemates on GM crops exist. However, to '
             'deliver yields to support the populations of the region and '
             'ensure continued protection of these yields, wheat must '
             'eventually become part of the GM family.  '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is required for '
             'the maintenance of genome stability. Unsurprisingly, mutations '
             'in MMR genes occur in a wide range of different cancers. Studies '
             'thus far have largely focused on specific tumor types or MMR '
             'mutations; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that a '
             'therapy targeting MMR deficiency in general would be clinically '
             'very beneficial.  Experimental Design: Based on a '
             'drug-repositioning approach, we screened a large panel of cell '
             'lines with various MMR deficiencies from a range of different '
             'tumor types with a compound drug library of previously approved '
             'drugs. We have identified the potassium-sparing diuretic drug '
             'triamterene, as a novel sensitizing agent in MMR-deficient tumor '
             'cells, in vitro and in vivo .  Results: The selective tumor cell '
             'cytotoxicity of triamterene occurs through its antifolate '
             'activity and depends on the activity of the folate synthesis '
             'enzyme thymidylate synthase. Triamterene leads to a thymidylate '
             'synthase-dependent differential increase in reactive oxygen '
             'species in MMR-deficient cells, ultimately resulting in an '
             'increase in DNA double-strand breaks.  Conclusions: '
             'Conclusively, our data reveal a new drug repurposing and novel '
             'therapeutic strategy that has potential for the treatment of MMR '
             'deficiency in a range of different tumor types and could '

{'abstract': 'A key element of leadership is the decision to shoulder '
             "responsibility for the welfare of others, whether they are one's "
             'family, a political party, or, as with heads of state, the '
             'entire country. In animal groups such as fish shoals or bird '
             'flocks, leadership may passively result from simple coordination '
             'principles ([ 1 ][1], [ 2 ][2]). By contrast, human leaders '
             'often actively make decisions on behalf of others. Although '
             'previous work has identified factors that predict those who will '
             'end up as leaders ([ 3 ][3]), it remains unclear how leaders '
             'decide to shoulder responsibility. On page 467 of this issue, '
             'Edelson et al. ([ 4 ][4]) provide further understanding on the '
             'psychological and neural processes engaged when someone decides '
             'to lead. They show that such decisions are intimately linked to '
             'our confidence in making decisions for others.  Edelson et al. '
             'asked volunteers to decide whether to accept or reject a series '
             'of risky lotteries for points (such as a 60% chance of winning '
             '50 points set against a 40% chance of losing 30 points) that '
             'were converted to a monetary bonus. These types of lottery '
             'problems can be used to estimate baseline decision-making such '
             'as risk and loss aversion. Participants were then faced with the '
             'same lotteries as part of a four-person group, whom they had '
             'gotten to know in a series of team-building games. In a clever '
             'design, there were two types of scenarios in this phase: Half of '
             'the decisions only affected the earnings of the participant, '
             'whereas the other half also affected the earnings of the other '
             'group members. Mimicking a classic leadership dilemma, '
             'participants had the opportunity to defer their decision to the '
             'other group members instead of taking it on themselves. Perhaps '
             'because people were reluctant to shoulder responsibility, '
             'deferral rates were highest when decisions had consequences for '
             'the earnings of others.  Before the experiment, the same '
             'volunteers completed a questionnaire to measure leadership. '
             'Furthermore, because the study was conducted in Switzerland, '
             'where military service is mandatory for males, the researchers '
             'could record the actual military rank attained by some of their '
             'participants—a real-world measure of leadership experience. '
             'Interestingly, none of the decision-making indicators obtained '
             'in the baseline task predicted leadership. Nor did the overall '
             'tendency to prefer to take control of whether to accept or '
             'reject the lottery. Instead, the best predictor was a change in '
             'the rate of deferring when the decision had consequences for '
             'others—what Edelson et al. call “responsibility aversion.” '
             'Responsibility aversion was the lowest in those with the highest '
             'leadership scores, indicating that leaders did not change their '
             "behavior, despite the additional responsibility for others' "
             'welfare.  ![Figure][5]  Leaders are willing to take on decisions '
             'that affect others, even when the evidence is not clear-cut.  '

             'might underpin responsibility aversion? Recent progress in '
             'models of perceptual decision-making provide useful hints. One '
             'idea is that the decision to defer to the group is similar to a '
             'process of “opting out” of a choice when the evidence is not '
             'sufficiently strong ([ 5 ][6], [ 6 ][7]). This process can be '
             'modeled by using signal detection theory ([ 7 ][8]), a framework '
             'in which an individual compares noisy evidence about a stimulus '
             'to an internal threshold. When there is insufficient evidence '
             'for either choice option—that is, when confidence is low—the '
             'model predicts people will tend to opt-out or defer to others. '
             'If the threshold becomes more conservative when the decision is '
             'being made on behalf of the group, fewer decisions to lead will '
             'be taken, despite the subjective value of the gamble remaining '
             'constant.  An alternative model is that responsibility aversion '
             'is driven by how the value of a gamble is perceived—for '
             'instance, we might become more loss averse when the outcome of '
             'other group members is at stake, making the choice options seem '
             'less attractive. By comparing the fits of different models to '
             'their data, Edelson et al. found that, while the subjective '
             'value of gambles did not change between self and group '
             'scenarios, the deferral thresholds did.  It remains unknown what '
             "drives this greater demand for certainty when others' welfare is "
             'at stake, but several hypotheses suggest a rich seam of future '
             'work. One possibility is that a psychological cost of leading '
             'directly modulates the thresholds. An alternative account is '
             "that estimates of one's own ability, known as metacognitive "
             "beliefs, come into play when others' welfare is at stake ([ 8 "
             '][9]). For instance, individuals might feel less able to make '
             'decisions for others, which would manifest as a shift in '
             'deferral thresholds. Relating leadership characteristics to '
             'other measures of confidence (such as opt-out behavior) could '
             'uncover such relationships.  Edelson et al. also collected '
             'whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging data during '
             'the deferral task. Although exploratory, this analysis '
             'identified a network that helped to predict responsibility '
             'aversion and leadership scores across individuals. In '
             'particular, a dynamic causal model identified links between '
             'medial prefrontal cortex—previously shown to encode both '
             'subjective value and confidence ([ 9 ][10])—and anterior insula '
             'as important regions of the brain that mediate leadership '
             'decisions. In turn, this connectivity was modulated by temporal '
             'lobe regions commonly implicated in thinking about others. '
             'Future studies are now needed to ask how the elements of the '
             'signal detection model relate to activity of the nodes in this '
             'network.  Edelson et al. found that responsibility aversion was '
             'the best predictor of leadership scores. But a question of '
             'causality remains. People with low responsibility aversion may '
             'be more likely to become leaders; alternatively, leaders may '
             'have low responsibility aversion because they have substantial '
             'experience making choices on behalf of others. More broadly, the '
             'authors found that responsibility aversion did not correlate '
             'with the classic “big five” personality traits such as '
             'neuroticism or extraversion. However, data-driven approaches to '
             'quantifying personality may prove more informative, particularly '
             'given links between psychopathology and metacognitive beliefs ([ '
             '10 ][11]).  It remains to be seen whether a similar approach can '
             'predict variation in leadership style, such as autocratic or '
             'democratic leadership, and identify those who will be good '
             'leaders ([ 11 ][12]). In the study of Edelson et al. , '
             'participants with low responsibility aversion did not earn more '
             'money for the group. By using the tools of decision '
             'neuroscience, it may be possible to reverse engineer not only '
             'leadership decisions, but also the ingredients of good '
             'leadership.  1.  [↵][13]1.   A. J. King et al          ., Curr. '

             'on PA in clinical practice. The EULAR standardised operating '

             'A task force (TF) (including rheumatologists, other medical '

             'twice. In the first TF meeting, 13 research questions to support '
             'a systematic literature review (SLR) were identified and '
             'defined. In the second meeting, the SLR evidence was presented '
             'and discussed before the recommendations, research agenda and '
             'education agenda were formulated. The TF developed and agreed on '
             'four overarching principles and 10 recommendations for PA in '
             'people with iA and OA. The mean level of agreement between the '

{'abstract': 'Abstract  BackgroundThe treatment of latent infection with '
             'Mycobacterium tuberculosis is important in children because of '
             'their vulnerability to life-threatening forms of tuberculosis '
             'disease. The current standard treatment — 9 months of isoniazid '
             '— has been associated with poor adherence and toxic effects, '
             'which have hampered the effectiveness of the drug. In adults, '
             'treatment with 4 months of rifampin has been shown to be safer '
             'and to have higher completion rates than 9 months of isoniazid. '
             'MethodsIn this multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly '
             'assigned 844 children (<18 years of age) with latent M. '
             'tuberculosis infection to receive either 4 months of rifampin or '
             '9 months of isoniazid. The primary outcome was adverse events of '
             'grade 1 to 5 that resulted in the permanent discontinuation of a '
             'trial drug. Secondary outcomes were treatment adherence, '
             'side-effect profile, and efficacy. Independent review panels '
             'whose members were unaware of trial-group assignments '
             'adjudicated all adverse events and progression to active '
             'tuberculosis. ResultsOf the children who underwent '
             'randomization, 829 were eligible for inclusion in the modified '
             'intention-to-treat analysis. A total of 360 of 422 children '
             '(85.3%) in the rifampin group completed per-protocol therapy, as '
             'compared with 311 of 407 (76.4%) in the isoniazid group '
             '(adjusted difference in the rates of treatment completion, 13.4 '
             'percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5 to 19.3). '
             'There were no significant between-group differences in the rates '
             'of adverse events, with fewer than 5% of the children in the '
             'combined groups with grade 1 or 2 adverse events that were '
             'deemed to be possibly related to a trial drug. Active '
             'tuberculosis, including 1 case with resistance to isoniazid, was '
             'diagnosed in 2 children in the isoniazid group during 542 '
             'person-years of follow-up, as compared with no cases in the '
             'rifampin group during 562 person-years (rate difference, −0.37 '
             'cases per 100 person-years; 95% CI, −0.88 to 0.14). '
             'ConclusionsAmong children under the age of 18 years, treatment '
             'with 4 months of rifampin had similar rates of safety and '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Although autophagy plays important roles in malignant '
             'pathogenesis and drug resistance, there are few clinical agents '
             'that disrupt this pathway, and the potential therapeutic benefit '
             'of autophagy inhibition remains undetermined. We used medicinal '
             'chemistry approaches to generate a series of novel agents that '
             'inhibit autophagic degradation.  Experimental Design: ROC-325 '
             'was selected as a lead compound for further evaluation. '
             'Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to '
             'evaluate the selectivity, tolerability, and efficacy of ROC-325 '
             'in preclinical models of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with HCQ '
             'serving as a comparator. Markers of autophagy inhibition and '
             'cell death were evaluated in tumor specimens.  Results: ROC-325 '
             'exhibited superior in vitro anticancer effects compared with the '
             'existing autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in 12 '
             'different cancer cell lines with diverse genetic backgrounds. '
             'Focused studies of the mechanism of action and efficacy of '
             'ROC-325 in RCC cells showed that drug treatment induced hallmark '
             'characteristics of autophagy inhibition, including accumulation '
             'of autophagosomes with undegraded cargo, lysosomal '
             'deacidification, p62 stabilization, and disruption of autophagic '
             'flux. Subsequent experiments showed that ROC-325 antagonized RCC '
             'growth and survival in an ATG5/7-dependent manner, induced '
             'apoptosis, and exhibited favorable selectivity. Oral '
             'administration of ROC-325 to mice bearing 786-0 RCC xenografts '
             'was well tolerated, was significantly more effective at '
             'inhibiting tumor progression than HCQ, and inhibited autophagy '
             'in vivo .  Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that ROC-325 '

             'Proinflammatory response by the interaction between ENO1 and '
             'apolipoprotein B (apoB) was tested in vitro and in vivo using '
             'peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a K/BxN serum transfer '
             'arthritis model and low-density lipoproteins receptor (LDLR) '
             'knockout mice.  Results ApoB in the synovid fluid of patients '
             'with RA was identified as a specific ligand to ENO1 with a '
             'higher affinity than plasminogen, a known ENO1 ligand. ApoB '
             'binding to ENO1 on monocytes elicited the production of tumour '
             'necrosis factor-α, interleukins (IL)-1β and IL-6 through both '
             'p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB pathways. In the '
             'K/BxN serum transfer arthritis model, administration of apoB '
             'increased the production of proinflammatory cytokines and '
             'exaggerated arthritis severity. The severity of K/BxN serum '
             'transfer arthritis in LDLR knockout mice was comparable with '
             'wild-type mice.  Conclusions A key component of atherogenic '
             'lipids, apoB, aggravated arthritis by potentiating the '
             'inflammatory response via its interaction with ENO1 expressed on '
             'the surface of immune cells. This suggests a novel mechanism by '
             'which lipid metabolism regulates chronic inflammation in RA.',

{'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe indirect water-deprivation test is the '
             'current reference standard for the diagnosis of diabetes '
             'insipidus. However, it is technically cumbersome to administer, '
             'and the results are often inaccurate. The current study compared '
             'the indirect water-deprivation test with direct detection of '
             'plasma copeptin, a precursor-derived surrogate of arginine '
             'vasopressin.MethodsFrom 2013 to 2017, we recruited 156 patients '
             'with hypotonic polyuria at 11 medical centers to undergo both '
             'water-deprivation and hypertonic saline infusion tests. In the '
             'latter test, plasma copeptin was measured when the plasma sodium '
             'level had increased to at least 150 mmol per liter after '
             'infusion of hypertonic saline. The primary outcome was the '
             'overall diagnostic accuracy of each test as compared with the '
             'final reference diagnosis, which was determined on the basis of '
             'medical history, test results, and treatment response, with '
             'copeptin levels masked.ResultsA total of 144 patients underwent '
             'both tests. The final diagnosis was primary polydipsia in 82 '
             'patients (57%), central diabetes insipidus in 59 (41%), and '
             'nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in 3 (2%). Overall, among the 141 '
             'patients included in the analysis, the indirect '
             'water-deprivation test determined the correct diagnosis in 108 '
             'patients (diagnostic accuracy, 76.6%; 95% confidence interval '
             '[CI], 68.9 to 83.2), and the hypertonic saline infusion test '
             '(with a copeptin cutoff level of >4.9 pmol per liter) determined '
             'the correct diagnosis in 136 patients (96.5%; 95% CI, 92.1 to '
             '98.6; P<0.001). The indirect water-deprivation test correctly '
             'distinguished primary polydipsia from partial central diabetes '
             'insipidus in 77 of 105 patients (73.3%; 95% CI, 63.9 to 81.2), '
             'and the hypertonic saline infusion test distinguished between '
             'the two conditions in 99 of 104 patients (95.2%; 95% CI, 89.4 to '
             '98.1; adjusted P<0.001). One serious adverse event '
             '(desmopressin-induced hyponatremia that resulted in '
             'hospitalization) occurred during the water-deprivation '
             'test.ConclusionsThe direct measurement of hypertonic '
             'saline–stimulated plasma copeptin had greater diagnostic '
             'accuracy than the water-deprivation test in patients with '

{'abstract': 'Objective:We sought to determine the correlation between the '
             'probability of postoperative opioid prescription refills and the '
             'amount of opioid prescribed, hypothesizing that a greater '
             'initial prescription yields a lower probability of '
             'refill.Background:Although current guidelines regarding opioid '
             'prescribing largely address chronic opioid use, little is known '
             'regarding best practices and postoperative care.Methods:We '
             'analyzed Optum Insight claims data from 2013 to 2014 for '
             'opioid-naïve patients aged 18 to 64 years who underwent major or '
             'minor surgical procedures (N = 26,520). Our primary outcome was '
             'the occurrence of an opioid refill within 30 postoperative days. '
             'Our primary explanatory variable was the total oral morphine '
             'equivalents provided in the initial postoperative prescription. '
             'We used logistic regression to examine the probability of an '
             'additional refill by initial prescription strength, adjusting '
             'for patient factors.Results:We observed that 8.67% of '
             'opioid-naïve patients refilled their prescriptions. Across '
             'procedures, the probability of a single postoperative refill did '
             'not change with an increase with initial oral morphine '
             'equivalents prescribed. Instead, patient factors were correlated '
             'with the probability of refill, including tobacco use [odds '
             'ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–1.57], '
             'anxiety (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.15–1.47), mood disorders (OR 1.28. '
             '95% CI 1.13–1.44), alcohol or substance abuse disorders (OR '
             '1.43, 95% CI 1.12–1.84), and arthritis (OR 1.21, 95% CI '
             '1.10–1.34).Conclusions:The probability of refilling prescription '
             'opioids after surgery was not correlated with initial '
             'prescription strength, suggesting surgeons could prescribe '
             'smaller prescriptions without influencing refill requests. '

{'abstract': 'Intermittent fasting (IF) protects against the development of '

             'mediated changes in the gut microbiota would produce beneficial '
             'metabolites and prevent the development of DR. Microbiome '
             'analysis revealed increased levels of Firmicutes and decreased '
             'Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia . Compared to db/db mice on '

             "captured by the European Space Agency's Mars Express "
             'spacecraft.  PHOTO: ESA/DLR/FU BERLIN/BILL DUNFORD  Without '
             'water, no form of life as we know it could exist. There is '
             'therefore great interest in detecting liquid water on other '
             'planets of our Solar System. Landforms such as dry river valleys '
             'and lakes show that liquid water must have been present on Mars '
             'in the past ([ 1 ][2]). Nowadays, small amounts of gaseous water '
             'exist in the martian atmosphere, and some water ice is found on '
             "the planet's surface. Water droplets were seen condensing onto "
             'the Phoenix lander ([ 2 ][3]), and there may be reoccurring '
             'water activity on slopes during the martian summer ([ 3 ][4]). '
             'However, stable bodies of liquid water have not been found on '
             'Mars. On page 490 of this issue, Orosei et al. ([ 4 ][5]) report '
             'an analysis of radar data from the Mars Express mission that '
             'shows the existence of stable liquid water below 1.5 km of ice, '
             'close to the martian south pole.  Ice caps similar to those on '
             'Earth exist at the martian north and south poles, known as the '
             'North and South Polar Layered Deposits (NPLD and SPLD, '
             'respectively). More than 30 years ago, Clifford hypothesized '
             'that liquid water might be present below the martian polar ice '
             'caps ([ 5 ][6]). Despite mean annual air temperatures of around '
             "−60°C, lakes exist below Earth's Antarctic ice sheet ([ 6 ][7]). "
             'Glacier ice insulates the bed from the cold surface. Thus, '
             'temperatures at the base of the Antarctic ice sheet, which may '
             'be as thick as 4.8 km, can reach the pressure melting point of '
             'water; the melting point is reduced owing to the pressure of the '
             'ice layer above. Water at the ice base reduces basal friction, '
             'leading to increased flow speeds. Finding liquid water below the '
             'martian ice caps might solve ongoing debates about whether the '
             'NPLD ice flow is due to deformation of the ice, deformation of '
             'the bed, or gliding over the bed or whether it is not flowing at '
             'all ([ 7 ][8]).  Water below the Antarctic ice sheet has been '
             'detected and analyzed by using radar waves that are transmitted '
             'actively above the surface. As the electromagnetic radar waves '
             'pass downward through the ice, they are reflected back at the '
             'interfaces between different materials, such as contacts between '
             'ice and bedrock, sediment, or liquid water (see the figure). '
             'Along a flight track, measurements are continuously carried out '
             'to form an image of the subsurface. Such a radargram shows '
             'reflectors from the surface and the base and often multiple '
             'weaker reflections from within the ice body. The radar wave '
             'reflection is stronger from a water interface than from a rock '
             'or sediment interface and therefore shows up as a relatively '
             'bright reflector in the radargram.  Orosei et al. now apply this '
             'method to data from Mars. The Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface '
             'and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) instrument on the Mars Express '
             'spacecraft collected radar measurements over the SPLD. Orosei et '
             'al. identify a distinct 20-km-wide bright reflector on multiple '
             'profiles collected over 3 years. They rule out a number of '
             'possible explanations for this bright reflector, leaving the '
             'existence of liquid water, either as a distinct water layer or '
             'as saturated sediments, as the only explanation.  It is even '
             'colder on Mars than in Antarctica. Temperatures at the base of '
             'the SPLD are estimated to be around −68°C ([ 7 ][8]), and thus, '
             'pure liquid water could not exist there under 1.5 km of ice. '
             'However, liquid water may still exist because the freezing point '
             'of water is far lower if large amounts of salts are dissolved in '
             'the water. Such brine lakes have been found on Earth, with '
             'salinities of up to 200 practical salinity units (psu) in the '
             'McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica ([ 8 ][9]). There, water remains '
             'liquid down to temperatures of −13°C. For comparison, ocean '
             'water has a salinity between 32 and 37 psu and freezes at about '
             '−2°C.  Salts of sodium, magnesium, and calcium have been found '
             'on the martian surface and can reduce the melting point of water '
             'to −74°C ([ 7 ][8], [ 9 ][10]); when in contact with ice, the '
             'salts can suppress the freezing point enough for liquid water to '
             'form ([ 7 ][8], [ 10 ][11]). The droplets observed on the '
             'Phoenix lander and the observed reoccurring water activity on '
             'slopes were explained by the presence of such briny water ([ 5 '
             "][6], [ 10 ][11]). Briny water can also explain Orosei et al. 's "
             'observation of a stable water body below the SPLD.  '
             '![Figure][1]  Using radar waves to detect water on Mars As the '
             'Mars Express spacecraft travels over the SPLD, it emits radar '
             'waves that travel from the satellite to the ice surface, where '
             'they are reflected. Part of the wave travels through the ice and '
             'is reflected at the bed below the ice. The reflections from '
             'water are stronger than from bedrock, providing evidence for a '
             'water body below the ice.  GRAPHIC: KELLIE HOLOSKI/ SCIENCE   In '
             'the future, with higher-resolution data, smaller liquid water '
             'bodies that influence the ice flow might be detectable below '
             "martian ice caps. Like Earth's ice sheets, the martian ice caps "
             'are important climate archives. Depending on the climate, the '
             'ice caps grow and shrink as a result of depositional and '
             'erosional events. This creates a unique stratigraphy within the '
             'ice caps, consisting of layers of equal age that scientists can '
             'analyze to derive information about past climate. Changes in ice '
             'flow owing to water at the base can change the appearance of '
             'these englacial layers; this needs to be considered when '
             'reconstructing their age. Analyzing these englacial reflectors, '
             'taking the new findings of liquid water below the SPLD into '
             'account, can therefore help unravel the climate history of '

             'seagrass in the Caribbean Sea off the Mexican coast.  PHOTO: '
             'LUIS JAVIER SANDOVAL ALVARADO/GETTY IMAGES  Seagrasses are '
             'marine flowering plants that are found along temperate and '
             'tropical coastlines around the world. They provide habitat for '
             'fish, shellfish, and marine herbivores such as turtles (see the '
             'photo) and dugong and also serve important physical roles—for '
             'example, by filtering sediments and reducing wave and current '
             'energies near coasts ([ 1 ][2]). By filtering the water column '
             'of pathogens, seagrasses reduce contamination in seafood while '
             'also reducing coral disease ([ 2 ][3]). Given the global '
             'distribution of seagrass and its role in climate mitigation and '
             'food security, the protection of these ecosystems has '
             'implications for the planetary boundaries within which humanity '
             'can safely operate ([ 3 ][4], [ 4 ][5]). Growing understanding '
             'of the roles of seagrass shows that their protection is crucial '
             'for staying within safe planetary boundaries and sustaining '
             'fisheries productivity and food security (see the figure).  '
             'Seagrass meadows are one of the most widespread coastal habitats '
             'on Earth. They are found throughout subarctic to tropical '
             'latitudes and exist in countries across the range of the human '
             "development index. However, like many of the world's natural "
             'habitats, seagrass meadows are in decline, with estimated global '
             'losses of ∼7% annually since 1990 ([ 5 ][6]). Poor coastal water '
             'quality and coastal development are among the major drivers of '
             'the loss ([ 5 ][6]).  Seagrasses have received comparatively '
             'little consideration in conservation and scientific research ([ '
             '6 ][7]), but this is beginning to change. Coordinated '
             'international calls for improved protection led by the World '
             'Seagrass Association and eventually signed by hundreds of '
             'scientists ([ 7 ][8]), together with advances in research, '
             'provide optimism for securing a future for seagrass.  Olsen et '
             'al. reported the genetic sequence of the most dominant seagrass '
             'species in the Northern Hemisphere, Zostera marina ([ 8 ][9]). '
             'This research showed how genetic adaptations of this species '
             "enabled seagrasses to become one of the world's most productive "
             'ecosystems. Key to this productivity was the ability to source '
             'the building blocks of photosynthesis in an aquatic saline '
             'environment. Thanks to this genome sequence, we can understand '
             'the reverse evolutionary trajectory that allowed angiosperms to '
             'live in the sea; as terrestrial plants adapted to life in the '
             'ocean, they developed genes that enabled them to take up '
             'nutrients and conduct O2/CO2 exchange in a saline environment '
             'through leaf epidermal cells ([ 8 ][9]).  ![Figure][1]  Threats '
             'to seagrass meadows Seagrass meadows supply a vast suite of '
             'ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, fisheries '
             'support, and coastal protection. They are part of an '
             'interconnected seascape; degradation of any habitat in this '
             'seascape has negative consequences for the other component '
             'habitats.  GRAPHIC: V. ALTOUNIAN/ SCIENCE   The productivity of '
             'seagrasses and their ability to store carbon in their sediments '
             'means that they are increasingly considered to be a crucial '
             "component of the world's carbon stores ([ 5 ][6], [ 6 ][7]). "
             'Seagrass is therefore a potentially crucial component of efforts '
             'to prevent rapid uncontrolled climate change. The Paris Climate '
             'Agreement has opened the door for integrating seagrass '
             'conservation programs into climate mitigation strategies. '
             'Evidence-based conservation decisions will require a more '

             'storage or release of this blue carbon.  Understanding how and '
             'why seagrass meadows store carbon in their sediments is based '
             'largely on correlative studies that attempt to use environmental '
             'or biological variables to predict carbon stock location and '
             'size across the broad range of seagrass bioregions ([ 9 ][10]). '
             'This research has, for example, shown how pollutants or '
             'disturbance can influence the microbial communities in seagrass '
             'sediments, weakening carbon storage capacity and providing a '
             'pathway to CO2 release ([ 10 ][11]). Other recent research '
             'highlights the role of sediment oxidation by seagrass root '
             'rhizomes, altering abundances of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ([ '
             '11 ][12]).  Seagrasses may also be key to climate mitigation in '
             'other ways. Their role as productive net primary producers in '
             'the coastal zone ([ 12 ][13]) has led to suggestions that they '
             'provide a local pH buffering effect ([ 13 ][14]). This is due to '
             'their rapid uptake of CO2, which pushes the carbonate chemistry '
             'toward a less acidic state ([ 13 ][14]). It remains to be shown '
             'whether seagrass-driven changes in the local carbonate chemistry '
             'can reduce the negative impacts of ocean acidification on other '
             'habitats and organisms, such as coral reefs ([ 13 ][14]).  '
             'Increasing recognition that seagrasses are an important part of '
             'the global and local carbon cycles is increasing the need for '
             'more accurate estimates of global seagrass cover. Around 300,000 '
             'km2 of seagrass has been mapped across the globe, but estimates '
             'suggest that the actual coverage could be more than 10 times '
             'greater ([ 11 ][12]).  Seagrass meadows are also important '
             'ecologically because they support high biodiversity. The floral '
             'diversity in seagrass meadows is relatively low, with '
             'approximately 72 seagrass species recognized globally, but the '
             'three-dimensional structure of their shoots, roots, and rhizomes '
             'attracts a high abundance and diversity of other organisms. '
             'Small grazing invertebrates profit from the colonization of the '
             'large leaf surface area by microalgae and the abundance of plant '
             'detritus. Invertebrates benefit from the oxygenation of '
             'otherwise sulfide-rich sediments.  This abundance of diverse '
             'animal life creates a vast feeding resource for numerous '
             'important fishery species. Seagrass meadows form critical '
             "nursery habitats for juvenile fish for ∼20% of the world's "
             'biggest fisheries, including for Atlantic cod and walleye '
             'pollock ([ 14 ][15]). An abundance of animal life in seagrass '
             'also creates fishing grounds that are highly accessible for '
             'fishers all around the world and require limited gear to fish. '
             'These fisheries are increasingly recognized as critical to the '
             'livelihoods of vulnerable people across the globe ([ 15 ][16]). '
             'The coastal location of seagrasses, however, also makes them '
             'vulnerable to land- and sea-derived threats, such as fertilizer '
             'runoff and the impacts of anchor use by boats, as well as to '
             'overexploitation of their productive fisheries.  The widespread '
             'threats to seagrasses places their long-term viability in doubt. '
             'But although scientists are documenting extensive degradation of '
             'seagrass meadows and their associated fauna ([ 5 ][6]), the '
             'evolving understanding of seagrass ecology also increases our '
             'capacity to conserve seagrass ecosystems. The Paris Climate '
             'Agreement, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the '
             'Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and other major international '
             'agreements such as the Convention on Migratory Species have '
             'helped to drive knowledge acquisition and the desire to protect '
             'seagrass meadows. With the right science and the political and '
             'financial will, seagrass meadows can thrive and contribute to '
             'ensuring our planet stays within its sustainable boundaries. But '
             'maintaining momentum in seagrass science, building on recent '
             'advances, and increasing public awareness is crucial for the '
             'long-term viability of seagrass systems.  1.  [↵][17]1.   J. L. '

{'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundCytoreductive nephrectomy has been the '
             'standard of care in metastatic renal-cell carcinoma for 20 '
             'years, supported by randomized trials and large, retrospective '
             'studies. However, the efficacy of targeted therapies has '
             'challenged this standard. We assessed the role of nephrectomy in '
             'patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma who were receiving '
             'targeted therapies.MethodsIn this phase 3 trial, we randomly '
             'assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with confirmed metastatic '
             'clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma at presentation who were '
             'suitable candidates for nephrectomy to undergo nephrectomy and '
             'then receive sunitinib (standard therapy) or to receive '
             'sunitinib alone. Randomization was stratified according to '
             'prognostic risk (intermediate or poor) in the Memorial Sloan '
             'Kettering Cancer Center prognostic model. Patients received '
             'sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg daily in cycles of 28 days on and '
             '14 days off every 6 weeks. The primary end point was overall '
             'survival.ResultsA total of 450 patients were enrolled from '
             'September 2009 to September 2017. At this planned interim '
             'analysis, the median follow-up was 50.9 months, with 326 deaths '
             'observed. The results in the sunitinib-alone group were '
             'noninferior to those in the nephrectomy–sunitinib group with '
             'regard to overall survival (stratified hazard ratio for death, '
             '0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.10; upper boundary of '
             'the 95% confidence interval for noninferiority, ≤1.20). The '
             'median overall survival was 18.4 months in the sunitinib-alone '
             'group and 13.9 months in the nephrectomy–sunitinib group. No '
             'significant differences in response rate or progression-free '
             'survival were observed. Adverse events were as anticipated in '
             'each group.ConclusionsSunitinib alone was not inferior to '
             'nephrectomy followed by sunitinib in patients with metastatic '
             'renal-cell carcinoma who were classified as having '
             'intermediate-risk or poor-risk disease. (Funded by Assistance '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Quiescent leukemia stem cells (LSC) are important '
             'resources of resistance and relapse in chronic myelogenous '

{'abstract': 'Instead of managing fresh water as one integrated resource, laws '
             'frequently treat groundwater separately from more visible, '
             'monitored, and managed surface waters. One under-recognized '
             'consequence of such legal fragmentation has been uncertainty '
             'about whether water rights for indigenous communities, which '
             'have been addressed in many countries to varying degrees for '
             'surface waters, apply to groundwater. In late 2017, the U.S. '
             'Supreme Court left standing a lower court ruling endorsing '
             'priority groundwater rights for Native American tribes by '
             'denying an appeal in Agua Caliente Band v. Coachella Valley '
             'Water District ([ 1 ][1]). This ruling establishes a new '
             "standard throughout nine western states within the lower court's "
             'jurisdiction and establishes persuasive, although nonbinding, '
             'legal precedent for the rest of the United States ([ 1 ][1]). To '
             "evaluate the ruling's broader potential impacts, we present new "
             'data cataloging existing Native American water rights and '
             'mapping unresolved tribal groundwater claims across the western '
             'United States. No court considered such a regional or national '
             'quantitative catalog or map. Drawing lessons from past U.S. '
             'experience, we then discuss how tribal rights may offer new '
             'opportunities to achieve sustainable groundwater management for '
             'society at large, with implications beyond the United States.  '
             '![Figure][2]  Trends in legal resolution of tribal water '
             'rightsGRAPHIC: ADAPTED BY N. DESAI/ SCIENCE   As the U.S. '
             'National Water Commission concluded in 1973, “[i]n the history '
             "of the United States Government's treatment of Indian tribes, "
             'its failure to protect Indian water rights for use on the '
             'Reservations it set aside for them is one of the sorrier '
             'chapters” ([ 2 ][3]). In 19 08, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled '
             'that Native American reservations include high-priority rights '
             'to surface water (i.e., federal reserved rights; here, for '
             'simplicity, “tribal rights”) ([ 2 ][3]). Since then, however, '
             'uncertainty surrounding whether these rights include groundwater '
             'has produced a patchwork of tribal groundwater rights. For '
             "example, Wyoming's Supreme Court held that tribal rights on the "
             'Wind River Indian Reservation did not include groundwater, '
             "Arizona's Supreme Court held that tribal rights include "
             'groundwater when other water sources do not suffice, and '
             "Montana's Supreme Court ruled that tribes may have groundwater "
             'rights ([ 2 ][3]). The Agua Caliente ruling by the U.S. Ninth '
             'Circuit Court of Appeals held that tribal rights “do not '
             'distinguish between surface water and groundwater” and provide '
             'tribes with “superior” access to groundwater “appurtenant” to '
             'tribal reservations ([ 1 ][1]).  Ten states asked the U.S. '
             'Supreme Court to overturn the ruling, arguing that it undermined '
             'authority that states have traditionally exercised ([ 3 ][4]). '
             'Similar concerns led both houses of the U.S. Congress to '
             'consider the Water Rights Protection Act of 2017, which could '
             'limit tribal groundwater rights by directing federal agencies to '
             'ignore hydrologic connectivity between surface water and '
             'groundwater when state law does not recognize such connectivity '
             '([ 4 ][5]). Nevertheless, unless the U.S. Supreme Court revisits '
             'tribal groundwater rights, they are now settled law across much '
             'of the western United States ([ 1 ][1]).  Tribal rights to '
             'groundwater exist along-side increasingly strained western '
             'United States water supplies. By 2030, projected consumptive '
             'water use is expected to exceed legally available surface water '
             'and groundwater in most western United States watersheds ([ 5 '
             '][6]). As surface water becomes fully allocated and climate '
             'change modifies river flows, groundwater withdrawals will likely '
             'increase to meet water demands. Much of the western United '
             'States has been slow to regulate groundwater pumping ([ 6 ][7]), '
             'and increased groundwater extractions can lead to land '
             'subsidence, drying springs and groundwater wells, streamflow '
             'depletion, ecosystem impacts, seawater intrusion, and reduced '
             'groundwater storage ([ 7 ][8]).  To provide perspective on the '
             'potential volume of tribal groundwater claims, we cataloged '
             'resolved and proposed tribal surface water and groundwater '
             'rights in the 17 western states where most Native American lands '
             'are located ([ 8 ][9]), most national groundwater withdrawals '
             'occur ([ 9 ][10]), and U.S. water scarcity is most acute. To '
             'date, tribal water rights have largely involved surface water '
             'but not groundwater (see the first figure). Collectively, 59 '
             'federally recognized tribes in the western United States have '
             'resolved and proposed surface water and groundwater rights to '
             '>10.5 million acre-feet annually (see the first figure and table '
             "S1). This volume exceeds 13 of 17 western U.S. states' "
             'individual annual freshwater withdrawals (see the first figure) '
             '([ 9 ][10]). Of the 59 tribes, 53 have resolved rights, six have '
             'proposed rights, and two have both. Before Agua Caliente, just '
             '4% of resolved and proposed rights were exclusively for '
             'groundwater (see the first figure). We expect that future tribal '
             'rights will place greater emphasis on groundwater.  '
             '![Figure][2]  Groundwater resources and Native American '
             'groundwater claims in the western United States Principal '
             'aquifers are defined by the U.S. Geological Survey as the '
             'uppermost regional aquifers or aquifer systems with potential to '
             'provide potable water. Observed brackish or highly saline '
             'groundwater on tribal lands is >1000 mg/liter total dissolved '
             'solids 80% of resolved tribal rights). Settlements allow tribes '
             'to negotiate water infrastructure funding or other concessions '
             'from governments and private water users but often depend on '
             'continued congressional funding ([ 2 ][3]). Settlements have '
             'authorized U.S. federal funding of ∼$5.2 billion, largely for '
             'water infrastructure (see the first figure), though the U.S. '
             'government estimated in 2016 that $1 billion in settlement '
             'funding remains “authorized but unfunded” ([ 10 ][11]).  To '
             'identify where tribal groundwater claims may offer new '
             'opportunities for groundwater access and management, we mapped '
             'tribal lands with unresolved groundwater claims alongside '
             'groundwater resources of potentially viable quantity and quality '
             'across the western United States (see the second figure). We '
             'estimate that up to 236 tribes in the western United States have '
             'lands with unresolved groundwater claims. The second figure '
             'illustrates three important features. First, most but not all '
             'tribal lands with unresolved groundwater claims exist in areas '
             'where major aquifers occur and can potentially produce '
             'appreciable quantities of groundwater. Second, some tribal lands '
             'with unresolved groundwater claims exist in regions with '
             'lower-quality groundwater. In locations where groundwater '
             'quality concerns exist, tribal groundwater claims may offer '
             'fewer opportunities for water access without sizable investments '
             'in treatment infrastructure. Because ongoing phases of the Agua '
             'Caliente lawsuit confront whether tribal rights require water of '
             'a certain quality ([ 1 ][1]), unresolved tribal claims may also '
             'offer new legal tools to compel groundwater quality remediation '
             'and treatment in such locations.  Third, the second figure '
             'reveals areas where unresolved tribal groundwater claims may or '
             'may not compete with nontribal groundwater use. In the 2017 '
             'appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, state and local governments '
             'argued that tribal groundwater rights would displace existing '
             'nontribal groundwater uses ([ 3 ][4]). Such conflict might occur '
             'in locations where tribal lands with unresolved groundwater '
             'claims are near many existing groundwater wells on nontribal '
             'lands. However, the second figure shows that tribal lands with '
             'unresolved groundwater claims exist near relatively few existing '
             'groundwater wells on nontribal lands. Some of these tribal '
             'lands, meanwhile, exist near many nontribal groundwater wells. '
             'The absence of comprehensive and consistent data on groundwater '
             'use, rights, quality, and supply for much of the United States '
             'precluded definitive identification of areas where tribal '
             'groundwater claims conflict with nontribal groundwater use ([ 7 '
             '][8]).  Lessons from past U.S. experience with tribal rights, '
             'which predominantly allocated surface water, suggest possible '
             'avenues by which tribal rights might promote more sustainable '
             'groundwater management for tribal and nontribal water users. '
             'Because tribal rights hold higher priority than most other water '
             'uses, deferring the recognition of tribal rights has added '
             'uncertainty and conflict to water management; legal settlements '
             'of tribal rights have thus helped to reduce water conflict. Some '
             'U.S. states have actively resolved tribal claims through '
             "dedicated settlement commissions. For instance, Montana's Water "
             'Right Compact Commission has reached tentative or final '
             'settlements with all seven tribes in the state (table S1). '
             'Proactive settlement of tribal groundwater claims can provide '
             'certainty and diminish conflict.  Forty-eight percent of homes '
             'on Native American land in the United States suffer from '
             'inadequate access to drinking water or waste disposal '
             'facilities, compared to 100,000 acres curtailed during the 2013 '
             'summer ([ 13 ][14]).  Tribal groundwater rights may afford '
             'similar opportunities to protect groundwater-dependent '
             'ecosystems. High-quality groundwater discharge to rivers and '
             'streams often sustains aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Few laws '
             'explicitly regulate impacts of groundwater pumping on '
             'groundwater-dependent ecosystems ([ 6 ][7]). Modern groundwater '
             'law also often incorrectly assumes that sustainable groundwater '
             "extraction equals an aquifer's recharge rate. This ignores that "
             'recharge often supplies groundwater discharge for surface water, '
             'springs, and dependent ecosystems. Indeed, the cultural and '
             'spiritual values that some tribes ascribe to water emphasize '
             'aquatic ecosystem health more than western law does. Some tribes '
             'also consider water to be sacred and retain traditional '
             'ecological knowledge that can inform ecosystem protection. '
             'Tribal rights can facilitate including these missing viewpoints '
             'in U.S. groundwater management.  After Agua Caliente, indigenous '
             'community groundwater claims are probably more prominent in the '
             'United States than any other nation. Yet many nations face the '
             'prospect of incorporating water claims for indigenous '
             'communities into contemporary water governance. For example, '
             'similar challenges and opportunities exist in Australia, Canada, '
             'Chile, and New Zealand, though no two nations legally recognize '
             'these claims in the same manner ([ 14 ][15], [ 15 ][16]).  As in '
             'the United States, surface water claims for indigenous '
             'communities have received more attention than groundwater claims '
             'in these nations ([ 14 ][15], [ 15 ][16]). The Agua Caliente '
             'ruling offers an opportunity to increase awareness of '
             'groundwater claims in these nations. By bridging surface water '
             'and groundwater, the ruling may also offer persuasive, though '
             'nonbinding, legal precedent for courts outside the United '
             'States, particularly in Canada and Chile, where courts have '
             'previously adopted terminology or approaches in U.S. indigenous '
             'water law ([ 14 ][15], [ 15 ][16]).  The U.S. response to the '
             'Agua Caliente ruling may also develop transferable lessons for '
             'improving water access. As in the United States, opportunities '
             'for major legal settlements to improve water access for '
             'indigenous communities exist in Canada and New Zealand, where '
             'treaties establish water claims ([ 14 ][15]). These '
             'opportunities may be more limited in nations without treaties '
             '(e.g., Australia and Chile) ([ 14 ][15], [ 15 ][16]). '
             'Additionally, U.S. experience with water markets may be relevant '
             'to Australia and Chile, where markets also exist. In Chile, '
             'because markets historically transferred water out of indigenous '
             'communities, a national Indigenous Land and Water Fund now '
             'finances reacquisition of water rights for these communities ([ '
             '15 ][16]). In Australia, although indigenous land accounts for '
             '>30% of all land, indigenous water entitlements constitute '
             '<0.01% of diversions ([ 15 ][16]), and similar to the United '
             'States, disputes persist regarding whether indigenous groups '
             'should be able to market water.  In the United States, '
             'meanwhile, the response to the Agua Caliente ruling holds '
             'potential to improve Native American water security. It also '
             'holds potential to demonstrate to the United States and other '
             'nations the importance, feasibility, and opportunities of '
             'recognizing groundwater claims for indigenous communities.  '

{'abstract': 'The secretion of insulin from β -cells depends on extracellular '
             'factors, in particular glucose and other small molecules, some '
             'of which act on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Fatty acids '
             '(FAs) have been discussed as exogenous secretagogues of insulin '
             'for decades, especially after the FA receptor GPR40 was '
             'discovered. However, the role of FAs as endogenous signaling '
             'factor has not been investigated until now. In the present work, '
             'we demonstrate that lowering endogenous FA levels in β -cell '
             'medium by stringent washing or by the application of fatty '
             'acid-free bovine serum albumin (FAF-BSA) immediately reduced '

             'lipase-mediated FA liberation from membrane lipids, by the '
             'addition of FA-preloaded FAF-BSA, or by the photolysis of '
             'cell-impermeant caged FAs. Our combined data support the '

{'abstract': 'Abstract  BackgroundA 9-month regimen of isoniazid can prevent '
             'active tuberculosis in persons with latent tuberculosis '
             'infection. However, the regimen has been associated with poor '
             'adherence rates and with toxic effects. MethodsIn an open-label '
             'trial conducted in nine countries, we randomly assigned adults '
             'with latent tuberculosis infection to receive treatment with a '
             '4-month regimen of rifampin or a 9-month regimen of isoniazid '
             'for the prevention of confirmed active tuberculosis within 28 '
             'months after randomization. Noninferiority and potential '
             'superiority were assessed. Secondary outcomes included '
             'clinically diagnosed active tuberculosis, adverse events of '
             'grades 3 to 5, and completion of the treatment regimen. Outcomes '
             'were adjudicated by independent review panels. ResultsAmong the '
             '3443 patients in the rifampin group, confirmed active '
             'tuberculosis developed in 4 and clinically diagnosed active '
             'tuberculosis developed in 4 during 7732 person-years of '
             'follow-up, as compared with 4 and 5 patients, respectively, '
             'among 3416 patients in the isoniazid group during 7652 '
             'person-years of follow-up. The rate differences (rifampin minus '
             'isoniazid) were less than 0.01 cases per 100 person-years (95% '
             'confidence interval [CI], −0.14 to 0.16) for confirmed active '
             'tuberculosis and less than 0.01 cases per 100 person-years (95% '
             'CI, −0.23 to 0.22) for confirmed or clinically diagnosed '
             'tuberculosis. The upper boundaries of the 95% confidence '
             'interval for the rate differences of the confirmed cases and for '
             'the confirmed or clinically diagnosed cases of tuberculosis were '
             'less than the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.75 '
             'percentage points in cumulative incidence; the rifampin regimen '
             'was not superior to the isoniazid regimen. The difference in the '
             'treatment-completion rates was 15.1 percentage points (95% CI, '
             '12.7 to 17.4). The rate differences for adverse events of grade '
             '3 to 5 occurring within 146 days (120% of the 4-month planned '
             'duration of the rifampin regimen) were −1.1 percentage points '
             '(95% CI, −1.9 to −0.4) for all events and −1.2 percentage points '
             '(95% CI, −1.7 to −0.7) for hepatotoxic events. ConclusionsThe '
             '4-month regimen of rifampin was not inferior to the 9-month '
             'regimen of isoniazid for the prevention of active tuberculosis '
             'and was associated with a higher rate of treatment completion '
             'and better safety. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health '

             'Individuals with MSK pain, stiffness or swelling in the past '
             'and/or during the last 7 days were evaluated by participating '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Acalabrutinib (ACP-196) is a novel, potent, and highly '
             'selective Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, which binds '
             'covalently to Cys481 in the ATP-binding pocket of BTK. We sought '
             'to evaluate the antitumor effects of acalabrutinib treatment in '
             'two established mouse models of chronic lymphocytic leukemia '
             '(CLL).  Experimental Design: Two distinct mouse models were '
             'used, the TCL1 adoptive transfer model where leukemic cells from '
             'Eμ-TCL1 transgenic mice are transplanted into C57BL/6 mice, and '
             'the human NSG primary CLL xenograft model. Mice received either '
             'vehicle or acalabrutinib formulated into the drinking water.  '
             'Results: Utilizing biochemical assays, we demonstrate that '
             'acalabrutinib is a highly selective BTK inhibitor as compared '
             'with ibrutinib. In the human CLL NSG xenograft model, treatment '
             'with acalabrutinib demonstrated on-target effects, including '
             'decreased phosphorylation of PLCγ2, ERK, and significant '
             'inhibition of CLL cell proliferation. Furthermore, tumor burden '
             'in the spleen of the mice treated with acalabrutinib was '
             'significantly decreased compared with vehicle-treated mice. '
             'Similarly, in the TCL1 adoptive transfer model, decreased '
             'phosphorylation of BTK, PLCγ2, and S6 was observed. Most '
             'notably, treatment with acalabrutinib resulted in a significant '
             'increase in survival compared with mice receiving vehicle.  '
             'Conclusions: Treatment with acalabrutinib potently inhibits BTK '
             'in vivo , leading to on-target decreases in the activation of '
             'key signaling molecules (including BTK, PLCγ2, S6, and ERK). In '
             'two complementary mouse models of CLL, acalabrutinib '
             'significantly reduced tumor burden and increased survival '
             'compared with vehicle treatment. Overall, acalabrutinib showed '
             'increased BTK selectivity compared with ibrutinib while '
             'demonstrating significant antitumor efficacy in vivo on par with '

             'that it affects not only the activity of neurons around the '
             'electrode, but also the activity of neurons whose long '
             'extensions happen to pass by the electrode. In some cases, this '
             'leads to off-target recruitment of nontherapeutic circuits that '
             'mask or negate the potential benefits of stimulation.  '
             '![Figure][1]  Does this mean that therapeutic efficacy will '
             'forever be limited by the physical restrictions of electrical '
             'stimulation? Thanks to biology, the answer is no. Spatially, '
             'neural circuits are nearly impossible to delineate, but '
             'genetically, they are organized along well-defined road maps '
             'that can be used to deliver therapies with a high degree of '
             'specificity.  My lab studies the organization of these genetic '
             'road maps in the basal ganglia, a primary structure associated '
             "with motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. This research into "
             'the basic biology of the basal ganglia led us to the discovery '
             'of cellular targets where focused interventions can induce '
             'long-lasting recovery of movement in a mouse model of '
             "Parkinson's disease.  Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are "
             'caused by aberrant activity of neurons in the basal ganglia, a '
             'tangle of interconnected brain nuclei that shape voluntary '
             'movement. Teasing apart the neural circuitry is not unlike the '
             'game pick-up sticks, in which a bunch of colored sticks are '
             'heaped in a pile on the floor and players must figure out how to '
             'remove them one by one, without bringing the whole pile crashing '
             'down.  Fortunately, we already know a bit about how the basal '
             'ganglia are organized. They consist of two parallel pathways '
             'that exert opposing effects on movement: The “direct pathway” '
             'facilitates movement and the “indirect pathway” suppresses '
             'movement ([ 1 ][2], [ 2 ][3]). The cellular architecture of the '
             'direct pathway is straightforward—signals pass directly from the '
             'input nucleus to the output nucleus. But the cellular '
             'architecture of the indirect pathway is more complex—signals '
             'pass through multiple intermediary nuclei on their way from the '
             'input nucleus to the output nucleus. One of these intermediary '
             'nuclei, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), is the primary target for '
             'DBS.  However, in fixating on the therapeutic potential of the '
             'STN, other components of the indirect pathway have become '
             "neglected, particularly the STN's neighbor, the external globus "
             'pallidus (GPe). This oversight motivated our study, which began '
             'as an investigation into the basic circuitry of the GPe and '
             'culminated in the discovery of its potential as a therapeutic '
             "node to induce long-lasting motor rescue in Parkinson's "
             'disease.  In the parkinsonian state, induced in mice by '
             'lesioning dopamine neurons with a toxin called 6-hydroxydopamine '
             '(6-OHDA), firing rates of GPe neurons are suppressed. Reversing '
             'this effect should alleviate motor deficits ([ 1 ][2], [ 2 '
             '][3]). Although straightforward, this hypothesis has been '
             'challenging to test experimentally because electrical '
             'stimulation in the GPe excites fibers of passage and recruits '
             'off-target circuits.  To circumvent this problem, we used an '
             'approach called optogenetics, where recombinant DNA encoding a '
             'light-sensitive ion channel (channelrhodopsin 2, ChR2) is '
             'delivered to GPe neurons by viral transfection, effectively '
             'giving us control over neural activity with the flick of a light '
             'switch ([ 3 ][4]). However, when we used this technique to '
             'increase the firing rates of GPe neurons in parkinsonian mice, '
             'we found that this intervention had no effect on motor '
             'symptoms.  At face value, this negative result seemed to '
             'contradict long-standing assumptions about how the basal ganglia '
             'worked. But, everyone who has ever done an experiment knows that '
             'there are many reasons that they may not work. So, we felt it '
             'wise to interpret this result with a healthy dose of caution and '
             'performed a series of follow-up experiments.  First, we '
             'confirmed with in vivo recordings that GPe neurons were excited '
             'by our optogenetic stimulation (they were). Second, we confirmed '
             'that motor deficits were reversed by using an alternative '
             'optogenetic intervention—stimulating motor-facilitating “direct '
             'pathway” neurons ([ 4 ][5]) (they were).  Taken together, these '
             'results demonstrated a need to revise long-standing assumptions '
             "about the GPe's impact on behavior and prompted a deeper "
             'investigation into its neural circuitry.  What assumptions had '
             'we made about the GPe that were incorrect? For one thing, by '
             'activating all GPe neurons at the same time, we were making an '
             'assumption that all GPe neurons were the same, even though we '
             'knew that this was not the case.  In our previous work, we had '
             'discovered that GPe neurons could be genetically subdivided into '
             'populations that differed anatomically and '
             'electrophysiologically ([ 5 ][6]). Could these genetic '
             'subdivisions provide a key to understanding what the GPe was '
             'doing functionally?  If genetic subdivisions were indicative of '
             'functional heterogeneity, we predicted that restricting ChR2 '
             'expression to a single-cell population might produce a better '
             'effect on behavior. To test this hypothesis, we repeated our '
             'behavioral rescue experiments, but this time, expressed ChR2 in '
             'only a subset of GPe neurons: those enriched with a molecule '
             'called parvalbumin (PV-GPe) ([ 6 ][7]).  Remarkably, this '
             'cell-specific intervention produced dramatically different '
             'behavioral results than global stimulation: Parkinsonian mice '
             'that had been almost completely immobile before stimulation '
             'began to move around the testing arena and by the end of '
             'stimulation, were moving at rates approximating those seen in '
             'healthy controls. The most striking feature of this behavioral '
             'rescue was that it persisted long after stimulation was turned '
             'off. Mice receiving cell-specific stimulation in the GPe '
             'continued moving for the duration of our 4-hour experiment (and '
             'possibly longer), far exceeding the therapeutic duration of '
             'current treatments, including DBS ([ 7 ][8], [ 8 ][9]). One '
             'possible interpretation is that this cell-specific GPe '
             "intervention wasn't simply masking motor symptoms, but rather "
             'was reinstating network function and by extension, restoring '
             'motor control.  Evidence that transient interventions in the GPe '
             'can reinstate basal ganglia output comes from '
             'electrophysiological recordings. Basal ganglia output neurons '
             'normally fire constantly with great regularity, but after '
             'dopamine depletion, their firing becomes irregular and bursty ([ '
             '9 ][10]). These aberrant firing patterns interfere with '
             'information encoding and contribute to motor impairments in '
             "Parkinson's disease ([ 8 ][9]). Cell-specific intervention in "
             'the GPe (but not global stimulation of the entire nucleus) '
             'attenuated pathological bursts and regularized firing of basal '
             'ganglia output neurons for hours after stimulation, persisting '
             'for the duration of our 4-hour experiment.  Discovering '
             'strategies to repair, not simply mask, circuit dysfunction is '
             'the next frontier in brain therapeutics. The discovery of '
             'genetically defined cell types, where targeted interventions '
             'restore basal ganglia function and rescue movement in a mouse '
             "model of Parkinson's disease, represents an important step in "
             'this direction.  Widespread use of optogenetics in humans is '
             'still years away, so are there other ways that our work could '
             'have a clinical impact? Current stimulation protocols for DBS '
             '(high amplitude, high frequency) are delivered with the goal of '
             'overriding aberrant signals from the basal ganglia that impair '
             'movement. However, knowledge about the underlying biological '
             'circuits can be used to develop more refined, effective DBS '
             'interventions.  Six years ago, a proof-of-concept study in '
             'humans demonstrated that a modified DBS protocol (“coordinated '
             'reset,” CR-DBS), designed on the basis of predictions about '
             'basal ganglia circuitry, provides longlasting therapeutic '
             'effects ([ 10 ][11]). Although we do not yet know whether CR-DBS '
             'engages mechanisms similar to those underlying our cell-specific '
             'stimulation in the GPe, both interventions converge upon a '
             'common mechanism: restoring basal ganglia output physiology. '
             'Future work will determine whether these interventions share a '
             'common therapeutic mechanism, or whether there are multiple '
             'pathways through which long-lasting rescue can be achieved.    '

             'PGF2α regulates hepatic glucose metabolism remain unknown. Here, '
             'we demonstrated that PGF2α receptor (F-prostanoid receptor; FP) '
             'was upregulated in livers of mice upon fasting- and diabetic '
             'stress. Hepatic deletion of the FP receptor suppressed '
             'fasting-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis, whereas FP '
             'overexpression enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis in mice. FP '
             'activation promoted the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes '
             '(phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase) in '

             'elicit Ca2+ release, which activated Ca2+/calmodulin-activated '
             'protein kinase II (CaMKIIγ) to increase FoxO1 phosphorylation '
             'and subsequently accelerate its nuclear translocation. Blockage '

             'knockdown of hepatic FP receptor improved insulin sensitivity '

{'abstract': 'Objective:To evaluate late outcomes from a randomized trial of '
             'division versus no division of short gastric vessels during '
             'laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication at up to 20 years '
             'follow-up.Background:Nissen fundoplication is an established '
             'procedure for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. '
             'Controversy about whether side effects such as dysphagia could '
             'be reduced by division of the short gastric vessels led to the '
             'establishment of a randomized trial in 1994. Early results '
             'showed equivalent reflux control and dysphagia, but more '
             'bloating after vessel division.Methods:A total of 102 patients '
             'underwent a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication between May 1994 '
             'and October 1995, and were randomized to short gastric vessel '
             'division (50) versus nondivision (52). Follow-up was obtained '
             'yearly to 20 years using a standardized questionnaire '
             'administered by a blinded investigator. Clinical outcomes at 20 '
             'years or most recent follow-up were determined.Results:No '
             'significant differences for heartburn symptom and satisfaction '
             'scores or medication use were found between treatment groups. At '
             '15 to 20 (mean 19.6) years follow-up, significant differences '
             'persisted for epigastric bloating: 26% versus 50% for '
             'nondivision versus division groups (P = 0.046). Heartburn '
             'symptom scores were low and not different for nondivision versus '
             'division groups (mean analog scores 1.4 vs 2.1/10, P = 0.152). '
             'Overall satisfaction after surgery was high in both groups (mean '
             'analog scores 8.1 vs 8.6/10, P = 0.989).Conclusions:Although '
             'laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has durable efficacy for '
             'heartburn symptom control at up to 20 years follow-up, division '
             'of short-gastric vessels failed to confer any reduction in side '
             'effects, and was associated with persistent epigastric bloat '

{'abstract': 'Guidelines to reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetes include '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) is a promising '
             'immunotherapeutic approach for cancer. Host lymphodepletion is '
             'associated with favorable ACT therapy outcomes, but it may cause '
             'detrimental effects in humans. We tested the hypothesis that '
             'IL15 administration enhances ACT in the absence of '
             'lymphodepletion. We previously showed that bioactive IL15 in '
             'vivo comprises a stable complex of the IL15 chain with the IL15 '
             'receptor alpha chain (IL15Rα), termed heterodimeric IL15 '
             '(hetIL15).  Experimental Design: We evaluated the effects of the '
             'combination regimen ACT + hetIL15 in the absence of '
             'lymphodepletion by transferring melanoma-specific Pmel-1 T cells '
             'into B16 melanoma-bearing mice.  Results: hetIL15 treatment '
             'delayed tumor growth by promoting infiltration and persistence '
             'of both adoptively transferred Pmel-1 cells and endogenous CD8+ '
             'T cells into the tumor. In contrast, persistence of Pmel-1 cells '
             'was severely reduced following irradiation in comparison with '
             'mice treated with hetIL15. Importantly, we found that hetIL15 '
             'treatment led to the preferential enrichment of Pmel-1 cells in '
             'B16 tumor sites in an antigen-dependent manner. Upon hetIL15 '
             'administration, tumor-infiltrating Pmel-1 cells showed a '
             '“nonexhausted” effector phenotype, characterized by increased '
             'IFNγ secretion, proliferation, and cytotoxic potential and low '
             'level of PD-1. hetIL15 treatment also resulted in an improved '
             'ratio of Pmel-1 to Treg in the tumor.  Conclusions: hetIL15 '
             'administration improves the outcome of ACT in lymphoreplete '

{'abstract': 'A multitude of brain disorders have debilitating impacts on the '
             'quality of life of a large patient populace, accounting for ∼30% '
             'of the global burden of disease ([ 1 ][1]). Most patients with '
             'brain disorders are unamenable to any form of treatment when '
             'first- and second-line interventions are ineffective ([ 2 ][2], '
             '[ 3 ][3]). Neuromodulation technologies can help millions of '
             'patients who suffer from such brain disorders.  Deep brain '
             'stimulation (DBS) has proven highly effective in treating '
             "Parkinson's disease and obsessive-compulsive disorder ([ 4 ][4]) "
             'and shows great potential for other conditions, such as '
             'depression ([ 5 ][5]). However, being a surgical procedure, the '
             'deployment of DBS is limited by the potential for complications '
             '([ 6 ][6]).  ![Figure][7]  Transient noninvasive brain '
             'stimulation methods, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation '
             '(TMS) ([ 7 ][8]) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) '
             '([ 8 ][9]), have been used in many human clinical and '
             'neuroscientific investigations. However, the ability of TMS or '
             'TES to directly stimulate deeper brain structures is achieved at '
             'the expense of inducing stronger stimulation of the overlying '
             'cortical areas, resulting in wider stimulation of these areas, '
             'which may approach the limits of safety guidelines ([ 9 ][10]). '
             'Recently proposed methods for noninvasive DBS, for example, '
             'using transcranial ultrasound ([ 10 ][11]) or the expression of '
             'heat-sensitive receptors and injection of thermomagnetic '
             'nanoparticles ([ 11 ][12]), may have limited immediate use in '
             'humans owing to the poorly understood mechanism of action ([ 12 '
             '][13]) and the need to genetically manipulate the brain, '
             'respectively.  We recently discovered a strategy for sculpting '
             'electrical fields to enable focused yet noninvasive neural '
             'stimulation at depth ([ 13 ][14]). By delivering multiple '
             'electric fields to the brain at slightly different frequencies '
             'within the kHz range—which are themselves too high to recruit '
             'effective neural firing, but for which the difference frequency '
             'is sufficiently low to drive neural activity—neurons can be '
             'electrically activated at a selected focus without driving '
             'neighboring or overlying regions. We call this method temporal '
             'interference (TI) stimulation, because the interference of '
             'multiple electric fields is what enables the focality.  We '
             'validated that interferometrically generated low frequencies '
             'could effectively drive neural activity by applying transcranial '
             'TI stimulation to anesthetized mice and recording the responses '
             'using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We found that neurons '
             'followed the low-frequency envelope of the electric fields but '
             'not the high-frequency carrier. For example, neurons '
             'experiencing 2 kHz and 2.01 kHz would fire at the difference '
             'frequency, 10 Hz, but were unresponsive to the 2-kHz carrier '
             'frequency.  To test whether this method can be used to recruit '
             'deep brain structures without recruiting the overlying neural '
             'layers, we applied transcranial TI stimulation and control '
             'stimulation conditions to the hippocampus of anesthetized mice '
             'and subsequently measured the brain activation profile by '
             'staining for the immediate-early gene c- fos . We found that '
             '10-Hz transcranial stimulation resulted in very broad c- fos '
             'expression profiles, with strong activation in the cortex and '
             'hippocampus. By contrast, transcranial application of 2 kHz + '
             '2.01 kHz TI stimulation, with an envelope amplitude peak deeper '
             'than the cortex, resulted in c- fos expression only in the '
             'hippocampus with no appreciable neural activation in the '
             'cortex.  To determine whether TI stimulation can evoke a '
             'behavioral response, we stimulated the forelimb region of the '
             'motor cortex of the anesthetized mice and measured the evoked '
             'motor activity. We found that simultaneous application of two '
             'currents, i.e., I 1 and I 2, at the same frequency of 2 kHz did '
             'not evoke motor activity. However, when the frequency of current '
             'I 1 was set to 2.001, 2.005, or 2.01 kHz while keeping the '
             'frequency of current I 2 fixed at 2 kHz, the stimulation evoked '
             'movement in the contralateral forelimb at the difference '
             'frequencies of 1, 5, and 10 Hz, respectively.  To test whether '
             'the evoked movement could be adjusted without physically moving '
             'the electrodes, we systematically increased the current I 1 '
             'above the forelimb area of the motor cortex and decreased the '
             'current I 2 above the whisker area of the contralateral motor '
             'cortex, keeping the current sum ( I 1+ I 2) fixed. We found that '
             'the movement amplitude of the contralateral paw decreased and '
             'that of the contralateral whisker increased. When I 1 was larger '
             'than I 2, the stimulation evoked a movement in the whisker '
             'ipsilateral to I 1 electrodes, with stronger movements evoked as '
             'the amplitude of I 1 increased compared with I 2. This suggests '
             'that the steering effect anticipated in our model ([ 13 ][14]) '
             'could indeed be realized in vivo.  The intrinsic low-pass '
             'filtering of the neural membrane, which renders high-frequency '
             'depolarization ineffective ([ 14 ][15]), explains the lack of '
             'electrophysiological effect by kHz-frequency electric fields '
             'without TI. Future studies may investigate whether low-pass '
             'filtering changes at higher field magnitudes, addressing earlier '
             'reports that very strong kHz-frequency electric fields (one to '
             'two orders of magnitude stronger than those used in our study) '
             'can block the propagation of compound action potentials in '
             'peripheral nerves ([ 15 ][16]).  The intrinsic low-pass '
             'filtering of the neural membrane alone cannot explain the '
             'ability of temporally interfering kHz-frequency electric fields '
             'to drive neural activity, because it would equally attenuate the '
             'low-frequency changes in the envelope amplitude of the '
             'superimposed fields ([ 16 ][17]). In this case, a nonlinear '
             'response to the electric fields ([ 17 ][18]) can give rise to '
             'new field components, including an electric field component that '
             'oscillates at the difference frequency. Such a low-frequency '
             'electric field would not be attenuated by the intrinsic low-pass '
             'filtering of the neural membrane and might be rectified, for '
             'example, by ion-channel dynamics ([ 18 ][19]).  In contrast to '
             'traditional electrical stimulation, the stimulus location (i.e., '
             'the peak envelope modulation) of temporal interference depends '
             'on the relative amplitude and orientation of the applied '
             'currents. Thus, by varying the relative currents and locations '
             'of the electrode pairs, essentially any point within a '
             'three-dimensional volume could be targeted for peak envelope '
             'modulation, albeit with a trade-off between the locus depth and '
             'its width and strength. For example, steering the peak envelope '
             'modulation to the center of a cylindrical tissue phantom (a '
             'petri dish filled with a saline solution) resulted in an '
             'envelope locus (i.e., distance out to 1/e of the envelope '
             'maximum) that was approximately twice as large and with a peak '
             'envelope amplitude one-tenth of that obtained when the peak '
             'envelope modulation was steered to a location near the surface '
             'of the phantom. In the future, it might be possible to pinpoint '
             'smaller regions of the brain by using a larger number of '
             'interfering kHz-frequency electric fields, contingent on a '
             'similar neural response to those individual fields.  '

             'concept. Current I 1 and current I 2 are applied simultaneously '
             'to the head via two electrically isolated pairs of electrodes '
             '(blue and black rectangles, respectively) at kHz frequencies f 1 '
             'and f 2, which are higher than the range of frequencies of '
             'normal neural operation but with a small difference Δ f = f 1 − '
             'f 2 that is within the range of frequencies of normal neural '
             'operation. The applied currents I 1 and I 2 create electric '
             'fields E 1( x,y,z,t ) and E 2( x,y,z,t ) inside the brain (blue '
             'and black arrows, respectively) that are superimposed by the '
             'neurons. The superposition field, that is, E 1 ( x,y,z,t )+ E 2( '
             'x,y,z,t ), has an envelope amplitude that is modulated '
             'periodically at a frequency that is equal to the difference '
             'frequency Δ f , sufficiently low to drive neural activity. The '
             'peak amplitude of the envelope modulation can be focused in '
             'depth.  GRAPHIC: ADAPTED BY N. CARY/ SCIENCE   Currently, TI '
             'stimulation cannot match the spatial resolution of implantable '
             'DBS at depth. Preliminary finite element method modeling of TI '
             'fields in human anatomical models shows that the TI stimulation '
             'locus can be roughly localized in large subcortical structures '
             '(e.g., the hippocampus) or in subcortical structures with '
             'preferential current pathways (e.g., the anterior cingulate '
             'cortex), but cannot be localized in very small and deep brain '
             'structures, such as the subthalamic nucleus.  In addition, TI '
             'stimulation requires large current amplitudes to achieve '
             'suprathreshold stimulation of deep brain structures '
             'noninvasively. In the future, it might be possible to achieve '
             'tighter focus and stronger TI locus at depth with a subdural '
             'electrode configuration that bypasses the current shunting at '
             'the scalp–skull interface ([ 19 ][20]). A minimally invasive '
             'configuration might be advantageous in clinical applications, '
             "such as in Parkinson's disease, that require continuous "
             'stimulation.  In summary, TI is a new brain stimulation modality '
             'whereby neural activity can be modulated by the application of '
             'multiple kHz-range electric fields. We have shown that TI '
             'stimulation can drive action potential activity in the live '
             'brain, recruit deep brain structures without the overlying '
             'cortical layer, and functionally map a brain region without '
             'physically moving the electrodes. We hope that the fact that TI '
             'stimulation uses well-known electrical fields and does not '
             'require chemical or genetic manipulation of the brain tissue '
             'will help speed up its clinical deployment, where it may benefit '
             'the large patient population in need of neural therapy.    '

{'abstract': '![Figure][1]  In his book The Problems of Philosophy , the '
             'British mathematician, philosopher and Nobel laureate Bertrand '
             'Russell writes, “Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake '
             'of any definite answers to its questions … but rather for the '
             'sake of the questions themselves; because these questions '
             'enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our '
             'intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance '
             'which closes the mind against speculation.”  These words '
             "describe very well how I feel about Steven Weinberg's Third "
             'Thoughts . This book should be read not only for its insightful '
             'and illuminating explanations of a wide range of physical '
             'phenomena but also for the opportunity it affords to follow the '
             'wanderings of a brilliant mind through topics ranging from '
             'high-energy physics and the makeup of the cosmos to poetry, and '
             'from the history and philosophy of science to the dangers of '
             'economic inequality.  ![Figure][1]  Manned spaceflight, while '
             'inspirational, has yielded fewer discoveries than unmanned '
             'missions, argues Weinberg.  PHOTO: NASA  Although most of the '
             "book's 25 essays have already been published, in The New York "
             'Review of Books and elsewhere, the collection also contains '
             'several original pieces. The whole, however, is greater than the '
             'sum of its parts. And even the few, inevitable repetitions are '
             'helpful because they make the scientifically challenging '
             'concepts (such as those related to the foundations of quantum '
             'mechanics or the details of the Standard Model of particle '
             'physics) more accessible to uninitiated readers.  In the more '
             'scientific essays, I liked in particular the ones entitled “What '
             'is an elementary particle?,” “Varieties of symmetry,” and “The '
             'trouble with quantum mechanics.” The first of these describes '
             'the tortuous road toward understanding which subatomic particles '
             'are truly “elementary.” The second gives an excellent '
             "description of the role symmetries play in deciphering nature's "
             "puzzles. (Since Einstein's theories of special and general "
             'relativity, physicists have realized that symmetry requirements '
             'essentially dictate the laws nature has to obey.) The third '
             'gives a perspicuous account of the apparent conflict between the '
             'fact that on one hand, quantum mechanics allows physicists to '
             'predict the results of physical processes with an astonishing '
             'precision, whereas on the other, its foundations in general, and '
             'the nature of experimental measurement in particular, are far '
             'from being understood.  The section entitled “Public matters” is '
             'in my opinion the best in Third Thoughts , and all essays within '
             'it—polemical as they may be—are excellent. Here, Weinberg '
             'examines weighty subjects such as climate change, big science, '
             'and manned space flight. Regarding the debate on climate change, '
             'he correctly concludes that “It is generally foolish to bet '
             'against the judgments of science, and in this case, when the '
             "planet is at stake, it is insane.” I couldn't agree more.  In "
             'his essay “The crisis of big science,” Weinberg addresses the '
             'serious problem of the rising costs of conducting research in '
             'both high-energy physics and astrophysics while the United '
             'States is also facing serious and sustained economic challenges. '
             'His proposed solution: “[A]ll the people who care about these '
             'things” should “unite in restoring higher and more progressive '
             'tax rates, especially on investment income.” He laments, '
             'however, the reality that “given the anti-tax mania that seems '
             'to be gripping the public, views like [this] are political '
             'poison. This is the real crisis, and not just for science.”  '
             'Weinberg has always opposed government spending on manned space '
             'flight, arguing convincingly that most of the scientific '
             'breakthroughs in astronomy and astrophysics have come from data '
             'collected on unmanned missions. Although he concedes that there '
             'is excitement in exploration, he notes that unlike in space '
             'flight, people who have made heroic efforts to, say, climb '
             'mountains have never expected their expeditions to be funded by '
             'the government.  The final section of the book, “Personal '
             'matters,” includes such topics as science writing, the '
             'importance of being (occasionally) wrong, and the similarities '
             'and differences between the craft of science and the craft of '
             'art. When he discusses the value of being wrong, Weinberg echoes '
             'Bertrand Russell: “It is profoundly instructive to learn that '
             'one has been wrong about something. It combats arrogance, and '
             'opens the mind to new ideas.”  Although one could perhaps '
             'quibble about a few very minor points—Weinberg may underestimate '
             'the inspirational value of manned space flight, or its potential '
             'value in the future—he has not been wrong in this captivating '

{'abstract': 'Objective In systemic sclerosis (SSc), early microvascular '

             'of the neurovascular guidance molecule Slit2 and its Roundabout '

             'Methods Circulating Slit2 levels were measured in patients with '
             'SSc and healthy controls. Slit2, Robo1 and Robo4 expression was '
             'investigated in SSc and healthy skin biopsies and explanted '
             'dermal microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs). Slit2/Robo4 '
             'function in MVEC angiogenesis was studied by cell viability, '
             'wound healing and capillary-like tube formation assays.  Results '
             'Circulating Slit2 was significantly increased in either SSc or '
             'patients with a very early diagnosis of SSc (VEDOSS) compared '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Determine the roles of the PI3K isoforms p110α and '
             'p110β in PTEN-deficient, estrogen receptor α (ER)-positive '
             'breast cancer, and the therapeutic potential of '
             'isoform-selective inhibitors.  Experimental Design: '
             'Anti-estrogen-sensitive and -resistant PTEN-deficient, ER+ human '
             'breast cancer cell lines, and mice bearing '
             'anti-estrogen–resistant xenografts were treated with the '
             'anti-estrogen fulvestrant, the p110α inhibitor BYL719, the p110β '
             'inhibitor GSK2636771, or combinations. Temporal response to '
             'growth factor receptor–initiated signaling, growth, apoptosis, '
             'predictive biomarkers, and tumor volumes were measured.  '
             'Results: p110β primed cells for response to growth factor '
             'stimulation. Although p110β inhibition suppressed cell and tumor '
             'growth, dual targeting of p110α/β enhanced apoptosis and '
             'provided sustained tumor response. The growth of '
             'anti-estrogen–sensitive cells was inhibited by fulvestrant, but '
             'fulvestrant inconsistently provided additional therapeutic '
             'effects beyond PI3K inhibition alone. Treatment-induced '
             'decreases in phosphorylation of AKT and Rb were predictive of '
             'therapeutic response. Short-term drug treatment induced tumor '
             'cell apoptosis and proliferative arrest to induce tumor '
             'regression, whereas long-term treatment only suppressed '
             'proliferation to provide durable regression.  Conclusions: p110β '
             'is the dominant PI3K isoform in PTEN-deficient, ER+ breast '
             'cancer cells. Upon p110β inhibition, p110α did not induce '
             'significant reactivation of AKT, but combined targeting of '
             'p110α/β most effectively induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo '
             'and provided durable tumor regression. Because apoptosis and '
             'tumor regression occurred early but not late in the treatment '
             'course, and proliferative arrest was maintained throughout '

{'abstract': 'SummaryBackgroundA deceleration in the increase in cancer '
             'incidence in children and adolescents has been reported in '

             'incidence trends at ages 0–19 years.MethodsWe invited all '
             'population-based cancer registries operating in European '
             'countries to participate in this population-based registry '
             'study. We requested a listing of individual records of cancer '
             'cases, including sex, age, date of birth, date of cancer '
             'diagnosis, tumour sequence number, primary site, morphology, '
             'behaviour, and the most valid basis of diagnosis. We also '
             'requested population counts in each calendar year by sex and age '
             'for the registration area, from official national sources, and '
             'specific information about the covered area and registration '
             'practices. An eligible registry could become a contributor if it '
             'provided quality data for all complete calendar years in the '
             'period 1991–2010. Incidence rates and the average annual '
             'percentage change with 95% CIs were reported for all cancers and '
             'major diagnostic groups, by region and overall, separately for '
             'children (age 0–14 years) and adolescents (age 15–19 years). We '
             'examined and quantified the stability of the trends with '
             'joinpoint analyses.FindingsFor the years 1991–2010, 53 '
             'registries in 19 countries contributed a total of 180\u2008335 '

             'cases due to differing practices of registration, and considered '
             'the quality indicators for the 165\u2008173 cases included to be '

             'by 0·66% (0·48–0·84) per year. The average overall incidence of '
             'leukaemia in adolescents was 23·6 (22·9–24·3) per million '
             'person-years, based on 4702 cases, and the average annual change '
             'was 0·93% (0·49–1·37). We also observed increasing incidence of '

{'abstract': 'Objective Skin inflammation and photosensitivity are common in '
             'patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic '
             'lupus erythematosus (SLE), yet little is known about the '
             'mechanisms that regulate these traits. Here we investigate the '
             'role of interferon kappa (IFN-κ) in regulation of type I '
             'interferon (IFN) and photosensitive responses and examine its '
             'dysregulation in lupus skin.  Methods mRNA expression of type I '
             'IFN genes was analysed from microarray data of CLE lesions and '
             'healthy control skin. Similar expression in cultured primary '
             'keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells was analysed '
             'via RNA-seq. IFNK knock-out (KO) keratinocytes were generated '
             'using CRISPR/Cas9. Keratinocytes stably overexpressing IFN-κ '
             'were created via G418 selection of transfected cells. IFN '
             'responses were assessed via phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 '
             'and qRT-PCR for IFN-regulated genes. Ultraviolet B-mediated '
             'apoptosis was analysed via TUNEL staining. In vivo protein '
             'expression was assessed via immunofluorescent staining of normal '
             'and CLE lesional skin.  Results IFNK is one of two type I IFNs '
             'significantly increased (1.5-fold change, false discovery rate '
             '(FDR) q<0.001) in lesional CLE skin. Gene ontology (GO) analysis '
             'showed that type I IFN responses were enriched (FDR=6.8×10−04) '
             'in keratinocytes not in fibroblast and endothelial cells, and '
             'this epithelial-derived IFN-κ is responsible for maintaining '
             'baseline type I IFN responses in healthy skin. Increased levels '
             'of IFN-κ, such as seen in SLE, amplify and accelerate '
             'responsiveness of epithelia to IFN-α and increase keratinocyte '
             'sensitivity to UV irradiation. Notably, KO of IFN-κ or '
             'inhibition of IFN signalling with baricitinib abrogates '
             'UVB-induced apoptosis.  Conclusion Collectively, our data '
             'identify IFN-κ as a critical IFN in CLE pathology via promotion '
             'of enhanced IFN responses and photosensitivity. IFN-κ is a '
             'potential novel target for UVB prophylaxis and CLE-directed '

             'IMAGES  The case report is dead. At least, it seems all but so '
             'in the realm of evidence-based medicine. It is thus thoroughly '
             "refreshing to read Helen Thomson's Unthinkable: An Extraordinary "
             "Journey Through the World's Strangest Brains and Eric R. "
             "Kandel's The Disordered Mind: What Unusual Brains Tell Us About "
             'Ourselves , two ambitious books that draw on clinical profiles '
             "to tell stories about our brains and minds.  Thomson's memoir "
             'aims to help us understand our brains through stories about '
             'exceptional others, who, she argues, may serve as proxies for '
             "ourselves. Kandel's book argues from neuroscience research and "
             'individual illness experiences for a biologically informed '
             'account of mind and brain. Both authors are unapologetic in '
             'their focus on what might be dismissed as merely anecdotal. Each '
             'foregrounds neurological and psychiatric patient narratives and '
             'experiences and from these draws out larger philosophical and '
             'scientific lessons.  By profiling and seeking meaning in '
             "individuals with curious neurological conditions, Thomson's "
             'Unthinkable follows a well-worn literary path but revitalizes '
             'the genre with an original and subtle shift to the personal. '
             "Perfected by neurologist Oliver Sacks, Thomson's technique was "
             'invented before the 19th century but most famously pioneered in '
             'the 20th century by such eminent neurologists as Morton Prince, '
             'Sigmund Freud, and Alexander Luria.  Where those authors '
             'represented patients as medical mysteries or as object lessons '
             'in physiology and philosophy, Thomson finds a timelier focus '
             'that corresponds with the growing advocacy for, and social '
             "attention to, individual patients' rights. Unlike her "
             "predecessors in the genre, Thomson enters her subject's "
             'lives—their restaurants, homes, families, communities, and '
             'online selves.  Her account, written in an easygoing, '
             'journalistic first person, moves at times from travelogue to '
             'spiritual odyssey. Yet it is at its best when Thomson listens—to '
             "people's descriptions of their neurological abilities, "
             "caregivers' accounts of their lives, and doctors' surprise at "
             "the varieties of the human condition.  Like Thomson's "
             "Unthinkable , Kandel's The Disordered Mind has similar "
             'sensitivity to personal experience. Kandel is an astute reader '
             'and a reflective observer. He has a penchant for thick '
             "description and a humanist's appreciation of the sublime. Much "
             'in his study reminds the reader of the 19th-century natural '
             'historian, in whom a singular instance in nature could give rise '
             'to a grand idea. There is certainly that nostalgic, synthetic '
             "voice in his text.  Neuroscience comes alive in Kandel's study "
             'through the personal and imaginative ruminations of disordered '
             'minds. He finds in the literary and artistic endeavors of '
             'psychiatric and neurological patients material illustrations of '
             'deeper neuroscientific concepts. Each vignette forms a natural '
             'experiment. Each patient becomes a novel performance of nature.  '
             'At his very best, Kandel recedes into the background and becomes '
             'a quiet observer of cultures, of societies, and most especially '
             'of minds puzzled at the experience of being a brain in a body. '
             'By granting so much agency to patient voices and personal '
             'knowledge, Kandel asks his reader to confront the anecdotal and '
             'inexplicable and think hard about what it means.  The varieties '
             'of neurological experience Thomson and Kandel describe are '
             'eye-opening. Both authors recall the most famous neurological '
             'patients as they describe their own evocative cases. Expected '
             'cameos include such famous patients as Phineas Gage, the famous '
             'railroad foreman whose personality changed after an iron rod '
             'destroyed much of his frontal lobe; the Jumping Frenchmen of '
             'Maine, a group of 19th-century lumberjacks who exhibited an '
             'exaggerated startle response; H.M., the man who was unable to '
             'form a new memory after 1953; and John Nash, the Nobelist and '
             'mathematician who suffered from schizophrenia. Yet these '
             'familiar patients feature only in the background.  Kandel turns '
             'up dozens of autobiographical works by mentally ill or '
             'neurodiverse people reflecting on their experiences: Here is the '
             'voice of Erin McKinney in his study describing her life with '
             'autism; there, the voice of Andrew Solomon describing his severe '
             'depression. Chuck Close, a portraitist who cannot “recognize '
             'individual people,” appears not far from Peter Moog, a likely '
             'schizophrenic whose religious imagery would partially inspire '
             "the Dadaist and Surrealist movements.  Where Kandel's book only "
             "visits such figures in brief passages, however, Thomson's spends "
             'whole chapters with them. The intimacy she acquires with her '
             'subjects grants her access to a variety of personal spaces '
             'normally denied to outsiders; she writes of their sexual '
             'attractions, their experiences of divorce and other life events, '
             'their permanent fears and anxieties, even their self-loathing '
             'and suicidal ideation.  Thomson meets people who see colored '
             'auras emanating from every person; she meets others who never '
             'forget a moment of any day, ever. She interviews people with '
             'synesthesia, schizophrenia, depersonalization, even whole-scale '
             'personality change, and she describes their extraordinary '
             'experiences often by examining the banality of everyday life. '
             'She finds answers to questions that must baffle neighbors. '
             'Sharon, who lives her life often completely lost in physical '
             'space, for example, explains to Thomson the reason for her '
             'large, unsightly giant lobster lawn ornament: “I see Louie … I '
             "know I'm home.”  If Thomson is sometimes too present in her own "
             'narrative, she is nevertheless an attentive and empathetic '
             'observer. It is clear from the way her encounters unfold that '
             'the people she meets on her journey throughout the book are '
             'drawn to her warmth, character, and curiosity. Nowhere is this '
             "clearer than in her treatment of Cotard's syndrome and Graham's "
             'experience of waking up dead (the delusion archetypical of the '
             'syndrome).  Graham, after a suicide attempt, acquired a host of '
             'subjective symptoms as a dead, living person: His emotions '
             'vanished; his sense of smell disappeared; even his addictions '
             'ceased to exercise any hold. He confides to Thomson: “I sat '
             'right there, just like you are now. All day. For months. I '
             "didn't have anything to think about, didn't want to do anything, "
             'say anything, see anyone. Just stared at that wall. Like a '
             "vegetable. Somehow my body hadn't realized my brain was dead. "
             'But I knew it was. Horrible really, thinking about it now. But '
             'that was that.”  Upon neurological examination, Graham was found '
             'to have brain areas where metabolic activity was so low it made '
             'sense to compare him with coma patients, leading him to become '
             'immortalized in a paper entitled, provocatively, “Brain dead yet '
             'mind alive.” Thomson notes that although Graham eventually '
             'regained some of what had been lost, the early clinical findings '
             'of his unique brain function were of almost no value to him. '
             "“‘It didn't change the fact,’” he divulged to her, “‘that I "
             'thought I was dead.’”  Despite foregrounding lived neurological '
             'experience, neither book shies away from clinical and scientific '
             'detail. Thomson, however, typically subordinates her discussion '
             'of scientific concepts and medical theory to the biographical '
             'and historical.  Kandel, meanwhile, combines his case '
             'perspective with brain genetics, brain imaging studies, and '
             'animal models of brain disorders. His volume is consequently the '
             'more technical of the two studies, but it is so skillfully '
             'written that it is easy to forget that his deeper purpose is to '
             'use the basic science and clinical medicine to ground his '
             'larger, more controversial argument: the notion that the mind '
             'can be studied biologically.  ![Figure][1]  Chromesthesia, a '
             'common form of synesthesia, manifests when sounds trigger the '
             'simultaneous perception of colors.  PHOTO: JOHN LUND/GETTY '
             'IMAGES  The ease with which Kandel puts patients into contexts '
             'within whole literatures on dopaminergic and serotonergic '
             'neurons, genetic mutations, and psychoanalytic categories might '
             'well suggest that all of this science is settled—indeed, even '
             'that the problem of reductionism has finally been solved. The '
             "reader should be alert, however, to Kandel's syntheses, such as, "
             'for instance, when he brings together (without fanfare) prion '
             'disease, misfolding proteins, and chronic traumatic '
             'encephalopathy. His is a brilliant and likely correct '
             'observation, but one that could only be termed an active '
             'hypothesis. Kandel nevertheless uses this to elaborate a far '
             'larger point about the relationship between the death of neurons '
             'in the brain and erratic, sometimes violent behavior.  What goes '
             'missing in both books, and indeed goes missing in most books '
             'that foreground neurological and psychiatric patients, is a '
             'deeper ethical and humane engagement with the place such '
             'individuals occupy when—to put it in the broadest terms—their '
             'access to social, racial, and economic justice is diminished. '
             'Both authors recognize that often the cases they present are '
             'lucky exceptions.  When describing Joel, a mirror-touch '
             'synesthete (someone who feels what other people appear to be '
             'feeling physically and emotionally), Thomson wonders how his '
             'life would have been “had he not been so bright.” Joel answers '
             'that without his intelligence, “his world could easily have come '
             'crashing down around him.” Kandel contemplates retributive '
             'justice in the context of brain disease, brain injury, and major '
             'psychiatric disorder and admits that the question of criminal '
             'responsibility is a vexing one.  Such observations make clear '
             'that even as we can know so much about the extraordinary '
             'individuals who become profiles of neurological diversity, we '
             'know too little about the lives of similarly situated '
             'individuals who suffer in silence on the fringes of society. How '
             'are these types of individuals insured? How are they coded in '
             'hospital records when they die? What is their experience with '
             'law enforcement and the criminal justice system? How many health '
             'care professionals suspect them of malingering?  Because even '
             'basic statistics on rare neurological conditions are often '
             'lacking, it is hard to assess how many individuals in such '
             'circumstances live lives diminished or enriched by their own '
             'neurological diversity. It is not hard, however, to imagine that '
             'for many, their demographic attributes stand firmly against '
             'them.  Whatever the answers to such questions, it seems likely '
             'that they would rely greatly on individual case studies rather '
             "than expansive statistics. And here, of course, Kandel's and "
             "Thomson's books are invaluable demonstrations of the value of "
             'anecdotal evidence. These books are compassionate testimonials '
             'to the value of thinking in cases.   [1]: pending:yes',

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors '
             'are promising epigenetic agents for the treatment of various '
             'subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the resistance '
             'of leukemia stem cells (LSC) to BET inhibitors remains a major '
             'challenge. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms underlying '
             'LSC resistance to the BET inhibitor JQ1.  Experimental Design: '
             'We evaluated the levels of apoptosis and autophagy induced by '
             'JQ1 in LSC-like leukemia cell lines and primary CD34+CD38− '
             'leukemic blasts obtained from AML cases with normal karyotype '
             'without recurrent mutations.  Results: JQ1 effectively induced '
             'apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in JQ1-sensitive '
             'AML cells. However, in JQ1-resistant AML LSCs, JQ1 induced '
             'little apoptosis and led to upregulation of beclin-1, increased '
             'LC3-II lipidation, formation of autophagosomes, and '
             'downregulation of p62/SQSTM1. Inhibition of autophagy by '
             'pharmacologic inhibitors or knockdown of beclin-1 using specific '
             'siRNA enhanced JQ1-induced apoptosis in resistant cells, '
             'indicating that prosurvival autophagy occurred in these cells. '
             'Independent of mTOR signaling, activation of the AMPK '
             '(pThr172)/ULK1 (pSer555) pathway was found to be associated with '

             'suppressed autophagy and promoted JQ1-induced apoptosis in AML '
             'LSCs.  Conclusions: These findings revealed that prosurvival '
             'autophagy was one of the mechanisms involved in the resistance '
             'AML LSCs to JQ1. Targeting the AMPK/ULK1 pathway or inhibition '

{'abstract': 'Countries worldwide struggle to manage the societal impacts of '

             'inform policy because scientists encounter difficulties '
             'acquiring drugs and conducting experiments ([ 1 ][1]). With the '
             'passage of the Cannabis Act ([ 2 ][2]), Canada becomes the first '
             'major economy to legalize marijuana for recreational use.  '
             '![Figure][3]  The legalization of recreational marijuana in '
             'Canada represents an important research opportunity.  PHOTO: '
             'PHILIP STEFFAN/FLICKR/CC BY  Canada seeks to prevent marijuana '
             'access to youth, promote public health and safety, and reduce '
             'strain on the criminal justice system by reversing the '
             'prohibitionist system currently in effect worldwide ([ 2 ][2]). '
             'Marijuana advocates have long argued that legalization of '
             'recreational use could lessen black market sales, decrease the '
             'power of criminal organizations, reduce incarcerations, save on '
             'enforcement costs for drugs, improve product safety, and provide '
             'jobs and revenue ([ 3 ][4], [ 4 ][5]). It has been difficult to '
             'find evidence to confirm or refute these claims, because for '
             'decades, marijuana research and access to materials '
             'representative of those on the underground market have been '
             'thwarted by governmental regulations ([ 1 ][1]).  With a '
             'substantial research budget ([ 5 ][6]), Canada can now become a '
             'trailblazer of marijuana studies. Federal legalization permits '
             'investigations into policy effects on crime, changes in user '
             'consumption, and the economics of marijuana, areas previously '
             'recalcitrant to research. Researchers will have access to more '
             'diverse germplasm for exploring medical applications, '
             'elucidating basic marijuana biology, and breeding improved '
             'industrial hemp varieties for the agriculture sector. Research '
             'should begin soon; without the establishment of strong baseline '
             'data, the opportunity to fully investigate transformations '
             'instigated by the new policy could be squandered.  Canadians are '
             'forging a new path in marijuana regulation, access, and '
             'research. However, permitting recreational drug use violates '
             'international treaties ([ 6 ][7]), to which Canada remains a '
             'party. The severity of United Nations sanctions on Canada, if '
             'any, will dictate whether other countries give marijuana '
             'legalization a chance. How long this opportunity to research key '
             'tenets of marijuana policy will remain viable is unknown. '
             'Researchers should exploit this opportunity to conduct '
             'politically unbiased studies, prioritizing those that accurately '

{'abstract': 'British Columbia (BC), Canada—a continental hotspot of wildlife '
             '([ 1 ][1]) and a Canadian hotspot of endangered species ([ 2 '
             '][2])—recently committed an unprecedented $14 million to '
             'reassess their wildlife management approach ([ 3 ][3]). The '
             "province's justifications for reform are laudable, including "
             'implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of '
             'Indigenous Peoples ([ 4 ][4]), addressing changing societal '
             'expectations about wildlife, and engaging a broad spectrum of '
             'the public. This shift in strategy would mark a substantial '
             'departure from the prevailing focus in North America, where '
             'wildlife is managed primarily for hunters ([ 5 ][5]). Drawing on '
             'the diverse perspectives, rights, and rich knowledge of numerous '
             'other members of the public who also value wildlife—including '
             'indigenous peoples, conservationists, scientists—could provide a '
             'unique opportunity for transformation.  Reassessing the '
             'fundamental scientific underpinnings of wildlife management '
             'would also provide continental leadership. Measurable '
             'objectives, evidence, transparency, and independent review are '
             'often missing from wildlife management across Canada and the '
             'United States ([ 6 ][6]). Ushering these important '
             'characteristics of research into practice would substantially '
             'improve the rigor in BC and make the province a model for '
             "elsewhere.  Translating BC's aspirations into tangible change "
             'will require independent oversight. Engaging citizens interested '
             'in cultural and other nonconsumptive values of wildlife could '
             'help to prevent the small subset of the population who hunt '
             'recreationally and its powerful lobbies from unduly influencing '
             "the government's decisions. Although this would entail bringing "
             'together often discordant groups, common interests already '
             'exist. For example, hunting advocates disagreed with '
             'conservation groups and most of the BC public about whether the '
             'recently banned grizzly bear hunt was acceptable ([ 7 ][7]), but '
             'agree about the importance of securing habitat amidst '
             'unrelenting pressures from extractive industries [e.g., ([ 8 '
             '][8], [ 9 ][9])].  BC stands at an historic moment where '
             'foresighted wildlife management reform could be imminent. The '
             'needed ingredients for transformation are available, including '
             'considerable untapped insight from a diverse and keen public and '
             'a framework for more rigorous wildlife management ([ 6 ][6]). '
             'Whether the potential of this moment is seized or squandered '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Constitutively active WNT signaling is a hallmark of '
             'colorectal cancers and a driver of malignant tumor progression. '
             'Therapeutic targeting of WNT signaling is difficult due to high '
             'pathway complexity and its role in tissue homeostasis. Here, we '
             'identify the transcription factor ADNP as a pharmacologically '
             'inducible repressor of WNT signaling in colon cancer.  '
             'Experimental Design: We used transcriptomic, proteomic, and in '
             'situ analyses to identify ADNP expression in colorectal cancer '
             'and cell biology approaches to determine its function. We '
             'induced ADNP expression in colon cancer xenografts by low-dose '
             'ketamine in vivo . Clinical associations were determined in a '
             'cohort of 221 human colorectal cancer cases.  Results: ADNP was '
             'overexpressed in colon cancer cells with high WNT activity, '
             'where it acted as a WNT repressor. Silencing ADNP expression '
             'increased migration, invasion, and proliferation of colon cancer '
             'cells and accelerated tumor growth in xenografts in vivo . '
             'Treatment with subnarcotic doses of ketamine induced ADNP '
             'expression, significantly inhibited tumor growth, and prolonged '
             'survival of tumor-bearing animals. In human patients with colon '
             'cancer, high ADNP expression was linked to good prognosis.  '
             'Conclusions: Our findings indicate that ADNP is a tumor '
             'suppressor and promising prognostic marker, and that ketamine '
             'treatment with ADNP induction is a potential therapeutic '

{'abstract': 'SummaryBackgroundInterest in the use of cannabis and '
             'cannabinoids to treat chronic non-cancer pain is increasing, '
             'because of their potential to reduce opioid dose requirements. '
             'We aimed to investigate cannabis use in people living with '
             'chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, '
             'including their reasons for use and perceived effectiveness of '
             'cannabis; associations between amount of cannabis use and pain, '

             'cohort of people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed '
             'opioids. Participants were recruited through community '
             'pharmacies across Australia, completed baseline interviews, and '
             'were followed up with phone interviews or self-complete '
             'questionnaires yearly for 4 years. Recruitment took place from '
             'August 13, 2012, to April 8, 2014. Participants were asked about '
             'lifetime and past year chronic pain conditions, duration of '
             'chronic non-cancer pain, pain self-efficacy, whether pain was '
             'neuropathic, lifetime and past 12-month cannabis use, number of '
             'days cannabis was used in the past month, and current depression '
             'and generalised anxiety disorder. We also estimated daily oral '
             'morphine equivalent doses of opioids. We used logistic '
             'regression to investigate cross-sectional associations with '
             'frequency of cannabis use, and lagged mixed-effects models to '
             'examine temporal associations between cannabis use and '
             'outcomes.Findings1514 participants completed the baseline '
             'interview and were included in the study from Aug 20, 2012, to '
             'April 14, 2014. Cannabis use was common, and by 4-year '
             'follow-up, 295 (24%) participants had used cannabis for pain. '
             'Interest in using cannabis for pain increased from 364 (33%) '
             'participants (at baseline) to 723 (60%) participants (at 4 '
             'years). At 4-year follow-up, compared with people with no '
             'cannabis use, we found that participants who used cannabis had a '
             'greater pain severity score (risk ratio 1·14, 95% CI 1·01–1·29, '
             'for less frequent cannabis use; and 1·17, 1·03–1·32, for daily '
             'or near-daily cannabis use), greater pain interference score '
             '(1·21, 1·09–1·35; and 1·14, 1·03–1·26), lower pain self-efficacy '
             'scores (0·97, 0·96–1·00; and 0·98, 0·96–1·00), and greater '
             'generalised anxiety disorder severity scores (1·07, 1·03–1·12; '
             'and 1·10, 1·06–1·15). We found no evidence of a temporal '
             'relationship between cannabis use and pain severity or pain '
             'interference, and no evidence that cannabis use reduced '
             'prescribed opioid use or increased rates of opioid '
             'discontinuation.InterpretationCannabis use was common in people '
             'with chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, '
             'but we found no evidence that cannabis use improved patient '
             'outcomes. People who used cannabis had greater pain and lower '

{'abstract': 'SummaryBackgroundThe relationship between macronutrients and '
             'cardiovascular disease and mortality is controversial. Most '

             'follow-up of 7·4 years (IQR 5·3–9·3). Dietary intake of 135\u2008'
             '335 individuals was recorded using validated food frequency '

{'abstract': 'Objectives Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying '
             'human cartilage degeneration and regeneration is helpful for '
             'improving therapeutic strategies for treating osteoarthritis '
             '(OA). Here, we report the molecular programmes and lineage '
             'progression patterns controlling human OA pathogenesis using '
             'single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).  Methods We performed '
             'unbiased transcriptome-wide scRNA-seq analysis, computational '
             'analysis and histological assays on 1464 chondrocytes from 10 '
             'patients with OA undergoing knee arthroplasty surgery. We '
             'investigated the relationship between transcriptional programmes '
             'of the OA landscape and clinical outcome using severity index '
             'and correspondence analysis.  Results We identified seven '
             'molecularly defined populations of chondrocytes in the human OA '
             'cartilage, including three novel phenotypes with distinct '
             'functions. We presented gene expression profiles at different OA '
             'stages at single-cell resolution. We found a potential '
             'transition among proliferative chondrocytes, prehypertrophic '
             'chondrocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes (HTCs) and defined a '
             'new subdivision within HTCs. We revealed novel markers for '
             'cartilage progenitor cells (CPCs) and demonstrated a '
             'relationship between CPCs and fibrocartilage chondrocytes using '
             'computational analysis. Notably, we derived predictive targets '
             'with respect to clinical outcomes and clarified the role of '
             'different cell types for the early diagnosis and treatment of '
             'OA.  Conclusions Our results provide new insights into '
             'chondrocyte taxonomy and present potential clues for effective '
             'and functional manipulation of human OA cartilage regeneration '
             'that could lead to improved health.',

{'abstract': 'Purpose: The success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation '
             '(HSCT) depends on donor cell homing to the bone marrow. However, '
             'there is no reliable method of noninvasively monitoring the '
             'kinetics and distribution of transferred cells. Using '
             'zirconium-89 (89Zr)-oxine cell labeling combined with PET '
             'imaging, we sought to visualize and quantify donor cell homing '
             'in a mouse bone marrow transplantation model.  Experimental '
             'Design: The effect of 89Zr-oxine labeling on bone marrow cell '
             'viability and differentiation was evaluated in vitro . '
             '89Zr-labeled bone marrow cells (2 × 107 cells, 16.6 kBq/106 '
             'cells) were transferred intravenously, and serial microPET '
             'images were obtained ( n = 5). The effect of a CXCR4 inhibitor, '
             'plerixafor (5 mg/kg) and G-CSF (2.5 μg) on bone marrow homing '
             'and mobilization were examined ( n = 4). Engraftment of the '
             'transferred 89Zr-labeled cells was evaluated ( n = 3).  Results: '
             '89Zr-oxine–labeled bone marrow cells showed delayed '
             'proliferation, but differentiated normally. Transferred bone '
             'marrow cells rapidly migrated to the bone marrow, spleen, and '
             'liver ( n = 5). Approximately 36% of donor cells homed to the '
             'bone marrow within 4 hours, irrespective of prior bone marrow '
             'ablation. Inhibition of CXCR4 by plerixafor alone or with G-CSF '
             'significantly blocked the bone marrow homing ( P < 0.0001, vs. '
             'nontreated, at 2 hours), confirming a crucial role of the '
             'CXCR4–CXCL12 system. Mobilization of approximately 0.64% of '
             'pretransplanted bone marrow cells induced a 3.8-fold increase of '
             'circulating bone marrow cells. 89Zr-labeled donor cells '
             'engrafted as well as nonlabeled cells.  Conclusions: 89Zr-oxine '
             'PET imaging reveals rapid bone marrow homing of transferred bone '
             'marrow cells without impairment of their stem cell functions, '
             'and thus, could provide useful information for optimizing HSCT. '

{'abstract': '![Figure][1]  Proposed legislation in Brazil could compromise '
             'conservation efforts in the Cerrado.  PHOTO: JUNIORS BILDARCHIV '
             'GMBH/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO  Brazil has relished a reputation of '
             'international leadership in biodiversity conservation. The '
             'country not only ranks first in megadiversity ([ 1 ][2]) but has '
             'one of the most extensive protected area (PA) networks ([ 2 '
             '][3]). PAs protect biodiversity and ecosystem services ([ 3 '
             '][4]), mitigating climate change ([ 4 ][5]). However, a recently '
             'proposed law ([ 5 ][6]) aims to repeal the legal status of newly '
             'established strict PAs (which allow only conservation-related '
             'use) for which land ownership conflicts are not resolved within '
             '5 years of PA creation. If the law is passed, all future PAs '
             'will be affected, as well as many current PAs. The retroactive '
             'effect of this law could compromise both terrestrial and marine '
             'PAs, including those in the Amazon and in two biodiversity '
             'hotspots: the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. In practice, the '
             'law would prevent the expansion of the PA network because '
             'socioeconomic conflicts take much longer than 5 years to be '
             'fully settled in Brazil. This setback has no precedent.  This '
             'law is in conflict with Article 225 of the Brazilian '
             'constitution, which states that “all have the right to an '
             'ecologically balanced environment” ([ 6 ][7]), and represents '
             "the culmination of a long-standing series of attacks on Brazil's "
             'biodiversity PA network ([ 6a ][8]). Such actions are at odds '
             'with scientific evidence suggesting the need for expanding, '
             'rather than decreasing, PAs ([ 7 ][9]). Recently, the '
             'nontechnical appointment of a candidate for president of the '
             'Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (the '
             'national PA authority) resulted in a nationwide protest '
             'organized by PA staff across Brazil ([ 8 ][10]). Ill-informed '
             'policies jeopardize Brazilian international leadership in '
             'conservation, pose substantial global threats to our ability to '
             'mitigate climatic change and secure ecosystem services, and '
             'undermine attempts to achieve the goals established by the '
             "Convention on Biological Diversity ([ 9 ][11]). We urge Brazil's "
             'legislators and decision-makers to turn down this unseemly '

             'systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) criterion; symptom duration '
             '<12 months and treatment-naïve). Bloods and skin biopsy '
             '(non-lesional) were analysed for two interferon-stimulated gene '
             'expression scores previously described (IFN-Score-A and '
             'IFN-Score-B). Forty-nine healthy controls (HCs) and 114 SLE were '
             'used as negative and positive controls. Musculoskeletal '
             'ultrasound was performed. Progression was defined by meeting '
             'classification criteria for AI-CTDs at 12 months.  Results 118 '
             'individuals with 12-month follow-up were included. Of these, '
             '19/118 (16%) progressed to AI-CTD (SLE=14, primary Sjogren’s=5). '
             'At baseline, both IFN scores differed among At-Risk, HCs and SLE '
             'groups (p<0.001) and both were elevated in At-Risk who '
             'progressed to AI-CTD at 12 months versus non-progressors, to a '
             'greater extent for IFN-Score-B (fold difference (95%\u2009CI) '
             '3.22 (1.74 to 5.95), p<0.001) than IFN-Score-A (2.94 (1.14 to '
             '7.54); p=0.018). Progressors did not have significantly greater '
             'baseline clinical characteristics or ultrasound findings. Fold '
             'difference between At-Risk and HCs for IFN-Score-A was markedly '

             'whether these treatment failures might reflect inhibition of '
             'vascular prostacyclin because of the increased systemic '
             'bioavailability of aspirin in this subgroup.How might '
             'weight-adjusted dosing of aspirin affect bleeding risk? In the '
             'trials included in the analysis, 80% of men and nearly 50% of '
             'women weighed 70 kg or more. Thus, weight-adjusted dosing would '
             'result in increased daily doses of aspirin in the majority of '
             'patients, which would be expected to affect bleeding risk. '
             'However, this association might not be linear because the '
             'authors observed that the bleeding risk on low-dose aspirin was '
             'elevated in patients weighing 70–90 kg despite the failure to '
             'prevent cardiovascular events. As the authors note, bodyweight '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Cirrhosis is a major risk factor for the development of '
             'hepatocellular carcinoma but remains underdiagnosed in the '
             'compensated stage. Fibrosis progression and cirrhosis are '
             'associated with changes in blood serum glycomic profiles. '
             'Previously, the serum glycomics-based GlycoCirrhoTest was shown '
             'to identify 50% to 70% of compensated cirrhosis cases in chronic '
             'liver disease cohorts, at >90% specificity. This study assessed '
             'GlycoCirrhoTest for the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma '
             'development in compensated cirrhosis.  Experimental Design: '
             'Serum glycomics were analyzed in sera of 133 patients, with '
             'compensated cirrhosis collected between 1995 and 2005 in a '
             'surveillance protocol for hepatocellular carcinoma using an '
             'optimized glycomic technology on a DNA sequencer.  Results: '
             'Baseline GlycoCirrhoTest values were significantly increased in '
             'patients who developed hepatocellular carcinoma after a median '
             'follow-up of 6.4 years as compared with patients who did not. '
             'For patients with a baseline GlycoCirrhoTest exceeding 0.2, the '
             'HR for hepatocellular carcinoma development over the entire '
             'study (Cox regression) was 5.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), '
             '2.2–11.7; P < 0.001], and the HR for hepatocellular carcinoma '
             'development within 7 years was 12.1 (95% CI, 2.8–51.6; P = 0.01) '
             'based on the cut-off value optimized in the same cohort. An '
             'absolute increase in GlycoCirrhoTest of 0.2 was associated with '
             'an HR of 10.29 (95% CI, 3.37–31.43; P < 0.001) for developing '
             'hepatocellular carcinoma. In comparison, the HR for the '
             'development of hepatocellular carcinoma within 7 years for AFP '
             'levels above the optimal cutoff in this study (5.75 ng/mL) was '
             '4.65 (95% CI, 1.59–13.61).  Conclusions: This prognostic study '
             'suggests that GlycoCirrhoTest is a serum biomarker that '
             'identifies compensated cirrhotic patients at risk for developing '
             'hepatocellular carcinoma. Screening strategies could be guided '
             'by a positive test on GlycoCirrhoTest. Clin Cancer Res; 23(11); '

{'abstract': 'The undergrad joining the lab where I worked as a research '
             'fellow certainly knew how to make a first impression. “I looked '

             "working with the best? That's me, of course!” He was clearly "
             "smart and ambitious. But I wasn't sure I was qualified to take "
             'someone under my wing. I had only started in research 2 years '
             'earlier, after finishing my medical degree. The bigger hurdle '
             'was the pressure to “publish or perish,” which made me hesitant '
             'to take on extra responsibilities. But, as I reflected on my own '
             'path into research and the crucial role played by my mentor, I '
             'realized that I needed to pay it forward.  ![Figure][1]  '
             "ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER  > “[My mentor's] character "
             'inspired me, and hopefully I will inspire my mentees.”   I had '
             'always been interested in research. But for various reasons, I '
             "initially pursued medicine—until my medical school's final "
             'requirement that I complete a brief clinical training period '
             'elsewhere led to a serendipitous meeting. I was waiting outside '
             "my clinical supervisor's office when the prominent professor who "
             'worked in the next office came by. I knew who he was, and I was '
             "impressed with his lab's work developing breast cancer drugs, "
             "but I didn't expect him to recognize me. I was startled when he "
             'said, “I see you in every meeting. What are you working on?”  I '
             'told him about myself and my work, and our conversation '
             'continued for more than an hour. His respectful, down-to-earth '
             'demeanor immediately made me feel at ease. He seemed to really '
             'care about what I had to say. When he learned that I was '
             'interested in research, he gave me a stack of papers to read and '
             "told me that he might have a spot for me in his lab. I didn't "
             'understand why this famous scientist would make space for me, '
             'someone with no research experience. But he saw something in me. '
             'After a proper interview, and finishing my medical degree, I '
             'joined the lab.  In the beginning, I had no idea what I was '
             'doing. But my mentor was understanding and patient. With his '
             'support, I got my footing and was starting to feel like a real '
             'scientist. Now, it was time for me to do this for someone else.  '
             'When I started as a mentor, I struggled a bit. I worried about '
             'accidentally teaching my mentee something inaccurate. Adjusting '
             'my teaching style to suit his learning curve was challenging at '
             'times. But we were patient with each other and worked together '
             "to develop a productive relationship. Following my own mentor's "
             'approach, I treated every encounter as a meeting of equals and '
             'encouraged open communication. My mentee asked tough questions. '
             'He challenged me and proved me wrong at times. And I loved it. '
             'By the end of his summer in the lab, I had a newfound '
             'appreciation for the rewards of being a mentor. Mentorship '
             'sharpened my communication, teaching, and technical skills, and '
             'it gave me a sense of purpose, confidence, and fulfillment.  '
             'Since that undergrad left our lab, I have continued serving as a '
             'mentor for other students. Each relationship is enriching in its '
             'own way. Recently, for example, I learned how to support a '
             'mentee through failure. My current mentee and I had worked '
             "tirelessly to prepare for her university's undergraduate "
             "research competition, but she didn't win and was quite "
             "disappointed. I didn't want this one setback to extinguish her "
             'fire for research, so it was up to me to provide a positive, '
             'encouraging perspective. I took her out for dinner to celebrate '
             'her will to compete and the experience she had gained. And I '
             'told her about a recent disappointment of my own—losing a '
             'science communication competition—to show her that she was not '
             'alone.  I was recently accepted into a split-site Ph.D. program '
             'at another institution, through which I will earn my research '
             "doctorate while continuing my current projects in my mentor's "
             'lab. This opportunity was only possible because my mentor took a '
             'chance on me. His character inspired me, and hopefully I will '
             'inspire my mentees similarly. There are many amazing individuals '
             'waiting for someone to apply just enough pressure to turn them '
             'from rock to diamond. We must all try to be those “someones.”   '

             'fluoxetine (0·88, 0·80–0·96) were associated with fewer dropouts '

             'OBSERVATORY & THE NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY  Ignoring '
             'the lessons of mythology, Betsy Congdon has spent the first '
             'decade of her young engineering career on a singular quest: to '
             'build something that will fly dangerously close to the sun.  On '
             'a drizzly day in May at the Johns Hopkins University Applied '
             'Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, Congdon crouches '
             "next to a foil-wrapped test copy of her team's product: a "
             'carbon-foam heat shield, a little wider and a lot thinner than a '
             'king size mattress. Another copy sits nearby, a flight-ready '
             'spare sealed in a metal drum stamped with an unintentionally '
             'ironic warning: “Do not expose to direct sunlight.”  The real '
             'one has headed south to Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where '
             'on or soon after 11 August, it will blast off, fastened to the '
             "business end of NASA's Parker Solar Probe. Six weeks later, the "
             "probe will reach Venus. That planet's gravity will tip the probe "
             'toward the heart of the solar system. Six weeks after that, '
             "Parker will plunge through the sun's corona, a tenuous "
             'atmosphere of hot charged particles, or plasma, on the first of '
             'two dozen flybys between now and 2024.  During those flybys, the '
             "heat shield must keep the probe's fragile electronics safe while "
             'temperatures on its surface soar up to a steel-melting 1370°C. '
             "The heat doesn't come from the million-degree plasma in the "
             'corona itself, which is too thin to transfer much energy, but '
             "from the sheer glare of the sun. Yet Congdon isn't nervous. "
             "“We've put it through all its paces,” she says, her voice "
             "echoing in the cavernous spacecraft assembly room. “We've put "
             'multiples of them through all their paces.”  If all goes well, '
             'the spacecraft—safe in the shadow of the shield—will beam back a '
             "record of the corona's plasma and the tangled net of magnetic "
             'fields that shape it. Those data could solve fundamental '
             'mysteries. For example, what heats the plasma to more than 200 '
             "times the temperature of the sun's surface? And how does the "
             'solar wind, a stream of plasma particles, escape into space? The '
             'solar wind has been a puzzle since solar physicist Eugene '
             "Parker, the probe's namesake, described it in 1958. "
             "Understanding it better could help today's researchers improve "
             'their forecasts of solar storms, the gusts of solar wind that '
             "crash into Earth's magnetic field and, at their strongest, knock "
             'out satellites and electrical grids.  ![Graphic][2]  GRAPHIC: C. '
             "BICKEL/ SCIENCE   The $1.5 billion Parker isn't the only big "
             'upcoming project aimed at the sun. On the Hawaiian island of '
             'Maui, astronomers are putting finishing touches on the Daniel K. '
             'Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), a $350 million project funded by '
             'the U.S. National Science Foundation. With a 4-meter mirror, '
             'DKIST is more than twice the size of the largest existing solar '
             "telescopes. It should be able to zoom in on the sun's surface "
             'with unrivaled sharpness when operations start in June 2020. '
             'That same year, the Solar Orbiter is due to launch, with €780 '
             'million in core support from the European Space Agency. The '
             'spacecraft will observe high-energy radiation rippling through '
             'the corona from slightly farther away than Parker.  “I really '
             'think these are transformative missions,” says Howard Singer, '
             'chief scientist at the Space Weather Prediction Center in '
             'Boulder, Colorado, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric '
             'Administration (NOAA). Singer and his colleagues deliver '
             'forecasts of solar activity not only for satellite and grid '
             'operators, but also for astronauts and airlines that fly near '
             'the poles, where high-energy, tissue-penetrating particles more '
             "readily slip through Earth's magnetic field.  If current "
             'schedules hold, DKIST and the Solar Orbiter will observe the '
             'corona well before Parker makes its closest solar flybys in '
             '2024. That timing should allow heliophysicists to mix and match '
             'remote and in situ data—collected at the same moment, no '
             'less—enabling them to measure changes in the corona while '
             "watching the sun's roiling surface for clues to the processes "
             'that stir and heat it. Earlier this year at APL, representatives '
             'of the three projects met for the first time to discuss how they '
             'could tackle the corona together. “It is absolutely a unique '
             'time for solar physics,” says Valentin Martínez Pillet, director '
             'of the National Solar Observatory in Boulder, the organization '
             'building DKIST. “There is combined science that we can do that '
             "is going to be awesome.”  PARKER'S JOURNEY to the sun fulfills "
             'an ambition as old as the U.S. space program itself. In 1958, '
             "still reeling from the success of the Soviet Union's Sputnik "
             'satellite, a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) committee '
             'chaired by early space physicists John Simpson and James Van '
             'Allen brainstormed a wish list of missions that, scientifically, '
             'could put the United States in the lead in space. One concept '
             "was a probe that would venture inside Mercury's orbit to taste "
             'solar plasma.  For decades, the idea did not budge from the wish '
             "list. “We've tried it half a dozen times,” says Chris St. Cyr, "
             "project scientist for NASA's contributions to the Solar Orbiter "
             'at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “It never '
             'got the political will of the science community at the same time '
             'the funding was available.”  By the early 2000s, NASA and NAS '
             'were both pushing a solar probe as a top priority. Parker, the '
             'eventual result, will come within 0.04 astronomical units (AU) '
             'of the sun. (One AU is the average distance between the sun and '
             "Earth.) That's 10 times closer than Mercury's path and seven "
             'times closer than the current record holders, the Helios probes '
             'of the mid-1970s, built by West Germany and NASA. The twin '
             "probes spun once per second to evenly distribute the sun's "
             "heat.  Even 0.04 AU represents a compromise for Parker. NASA's "
             'previous solar probe concept, devised in 2005, would have gone '
             'at least twice as close for one or two flybys.  But it was '
             'expensive. In 2007, NASA asked APL managers to cut costs. In '
             'response, they changed the mission design, backing off from the '
             'sun and increasing the number of flybys to compensate. They also '
             'replaced a costly radioisotope generator with panels to draw '
             'solar power—all too abundant in the corona. To prevent '
             'overheating, Parker hides the panels in the shade under the heat '
             'shield as it draws closest to the sun in its elliptical orbit. '
             "The probe stretches the panels open to catch the sun's rays when "
             'the spacecraft is farther away, while a pumping system cools '
             "them with a water bath.  Then there's that all-important shield. "
             'In her office upstairs from the clean room where Parker was '
             'built, Congdon keeps a suitcase-size square of the black '
             "material used for testing. It's built like a sandwich, with a "
             'thick filling of carbon foam, an airy mesh of carbon molecules, '
             'sitting between thin sheets of carbon-carbon, a material woven '
             'from carbon fibers that gets stronger, not weaker, when heated '
             'to a few thousand degrees. Thick pads of carbon-carbon adorned '
             "the nose and wings of NASA's space shuttles.  Congdon picks up "
             "the sample and holds it out. It's surprisingly light—the "
             'full-size shield weighs only as much as a person. At a touch, '
             'the coarse foam exposed at the edges of the sample rubs off like '
             'the lead of a soft pencil. The outside of the real shield has a '
             'white coating designed to reflect as much heat as possible, but '
             'on this unpainted sample, parts of the surface are darkened, '
             'overtoasted.  Engineers have taken pains to ensure the shield '
             'never strays from its position between Parker and the sun, '
             'including when radio contact with Earth is cut off as the probe '
             "disappears behind the sun or when the sun's own radio emission "
             "drowns out the spacecraft's. If sensors discover that the heat "
             'shield has rotated out of position, an automated system engages '
             'to right the craft. “We need to recover within a few minutes '
             'before something gets severely damaged,” says Jim Kinnison, '
             "Parker's mission system engineer at APL.  Ironically, the heat "
             'shield is flammable on Earth in the presence of oxygen. One '
             'high-temperature test took a “terrifying” turn when the test '
             "chamber's vacuum seal broke and oxygen leaked in, Congdon says. "
             '“The thing went up in flames.” But in the rarefied plasma of the '
             'solar corona, oxygen is scarce and the few atoms there have had '
             'their outer electrons torn away by bafflingly high temperatures. '
             "Parker's science team hopes to figure out why.  THE SUN'S "
             'VISIBLE SURFACE , the photosphere, simmers at about 5500°C. '
             'Grade school physics holds that because the corona is farther '
             "still from the heat source at the sun's core, temperatures "
             'should fall. Instead, they soar to more than 1 million degrees '
             'Celsius.  Heliophysicists have battled for decades over the '
             'origin of this extra heat. On the broad strokes, at least, they '
             'agree. The energy probably starts as motion in the photosphere '
             'or just below, where astronomers see granules—seething, '
             'ever-shifting cells the size of Texas. Those are bubbles of '
             'convecting plasma, and they boil like a cauldron, carrying '
             'tremendous amounts of kinetic energy. Scientists also agree that '
             'magnetic fields transport the energy outward.  Unlike everyday '
             'materials, charged plasma responds to magnetism, flowing along '
             'field lines. The moving particles themselves create electric '
             'currents that generate additional magnetic fields. Sometimes the '
             'fields reach up through the surface of the sun and into the '
             "corona, which could establish a path for the granules' kinetic "
             'energy to be transformed into thermal energy.  “Beyond that, if '
             'we brought in five theorists, we might get 15 theories,” St. Cyr '
             'says. But the proposed pathways of coronal heating do fall into '
             'two general branches.  ![Figure][1]  The Parker Solar Probe '
             'awaits the addition of its heat shield and solar panels prior to '
             'launch in Florida.  PHOTO: NASA  In one, sudden changes in the '
             'protruding tangle of magnetic field lines pump heat into the '
             'corona. With both feet planted in the photosphere, many of those '
             'lines resemble the Gateway Arch of St. Louis, Missouri. But as '
             'the surface churns, the feet move around, tangling the lines '
             'overhead. Stress builds up. When the field lines suddenly snap '
             'into a more stable arrangement, vast amounts of energy are '
             "released into the surrounding plasma.  Missions such as NASA's "
             'orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory have monitored almost '
             'second-by-second changes on the sun since 2010. They have '
             'observed those abrupt changes, called magnetic reconnection, and '
             'shown that they can kick out solar flares. The events take place '
             "often enough to account for some, but not all, of the corona's "
             'heat. Theorists have long suspected that much smaller '
             '“nanoflares” could also pop off close to the surface, too small '
             'and faint to be detected. A million such flares per second, each '
             'about as powerful as a 50-megaton hydrogen bomb, could fully '
             "account for the corona's measured temperature.  If the corona's "
             'heat does come from swarms of undiscovered staccato explosions, '
             'freshly heated pockets of the corona should reach temperatures '
             'as high as 10 million degrees Celsius before the energy can '
             'spread around. And in recent years, satellites and suborbital '
             "rockets, observing above Earth's atmosphere in x-rays and the "
             'ultraviolet (UV), have spotted emissions from coronal plasma at '
             "those temperatures, adding indirect support to the theory. “It's "
             "there. That's sort of incontrovertible,” says Goddard "
             'astrophysicist Jim Klimchuk.  Other theorists envision a '
             'different path for heat rising from the depths of the sun. The '
             'motion of the bubbling plasma cells excites waves of magnetic '
             'energy that course outward. In theory, those waves can jangle '
             'field lines in the corona like ropes in a CrossFit '
             'gym—especially lines with one foot on the sun and the other '
             'dangling into space. That wiggling heats nearby particles, which '
             'steal away thermal and kinetic energy “like a surfer on the '
             'crest of a wave,” says Kelly Korreck, a solar physicist at the '
             'Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, '
             'Massachusetts.  The trio of upcoming missions should help '
             "apportion the corona's heat budget between reconnection and "
             'waves, and perhaps hint at specific subprocesses such as '
             'nanoflares, although Korreck sounds a note of caution: “There is '
             "no one telescope that's definitely going to find the answer.” "
             'Parker will traverse a path where wave heating is expected to '
             'dominate. If Parker senses waves, it can check how much energy '
             'they contribute. And by measuring just-cooked plasma close to '
             'the sun—say, the gust of hot helium atoms unleashed by a '
             'nanoflare—Parker should also be able to sniff out traces of '
             'reconnection heating events.  DKIST and the Solar Orbiter, for '
             'their part, will add to the picture by studying the area beneath '
             "Parker's path. Both observatories—DKIST, using infrared light; "
             'and the Solar Orbiter, using UV and x-rays—will map the '
             'fleeting, tangled field structures that might be sparking '
             'nanoflares.  The Parker probe will also explore the mystery that '
             'Eugene Parker, now a 91-year-old physicist emeritus from the '
             'University of Chicago in Illinois, left for his scientific '
             'heirs: What drives the gale of charged particles expanding '
             'hundreds of kilometers per second out into the solar system? Low '
             'in the corona, the solar magnetic field has a stiff hold on '
             'plasma. Somewhere above that, the particles move fast enough to '
             "shake free of the sun's gravity and escape into the solar "
             'system. That is “where the magic happens, where the solar wind '
             'is accelerated so much that it then takes off,” says Nicola Fox, '
             "the probe's project scientist at APL. “We'll be in that "
             "region.”  ![Figure][1]  The Parker Solar Probe's heat shield is "
             'lowered into a chamber that mimics the vacuum of space and the '
             'heat of the sun.  PHOTO: NASA  The wind, like the corona, seems '
             'to defy basic physics: It should cool and slow down as it begins '
             "to spread into the solar system. But it doesn't. Something keeps "
             'driving it outward—perhaps the energy emitted by particles '
             'following spiral paths or the dissipation of turbulent gusts of '
             'plasma. By recording the small-scale physics of the plasma it '
             'flies through, Parker will pinpoint where the wind takes flight '
             'and narrow the possible mechanisms that could launch it. “We all '
             'know the devil is in the details,” Fox says.  LAST OCTOBER , a '

             'the very wind he had described 6 decades earlier—partly from '
             'observations of comet tails pointing away from the sun like wind '
             'socks.  The idea was once controversial—two reviewers outright '
             "rejected Parker's paper. Now, the solar wind sits at the "
             'cornerstone of an emerging applied science. Understanding the '
             "corona's behavior on good days may prove key to predicting bad "
             'ones. Whatever physics accelerates the solar wind also launches '
             'dangerous solar storms.  Adverse space weather falls into '
             'several classes. Workaday solar wind would pose a health risk '
             "only to astronauts traveling outside Earth's protective magnetic "
             'field, to deep-space locations such as the moon or Mars. Solar '
             'flares hurl stronger bursts of particles and radiation toward '
             'Earth that can cause problems for satellites and, funneled by '
             "the planet's magnetic field toward the poles, create auroral "
             'light shows. The rarest and strongest events, called coronal '
             'mass ejections (CMEs), launch dense blobs of particles that can '
             "overwhelm Earth's field and cripple communications technology. "
             'In 1967, for example, the U.S. Air Force started to prepare for '
             'nuclear war after multiple early warning radar systems appeared '
             'to be jammed. The culprit, found in time to forestall disaster, '
             'was a massive CME.  “When will they occur? How long are they '
             'going to last? How intense are they going to be?” Singer asks. '
             '“There are huge gaps in understanding how to predict some of '
             'these phenomena.”  CMEs come with little warning. The NASA and '
             'NOAA satellites that track the solar wind hover near a stable '
             'Earth-sun gravitational point that lies just 1% of the way to '
             'the sun. At solar wind speeds, a space weather event picked up '
             'there can reach Earth 15 minutes later. So learning to discern '
             'warning signs of disruptive events right at the sun from data '
             'from Parker, DKIST, and the Solar Orbiter, will lead to better '
             'predictions, Singer says.  DKIST will take a microscope to the '
             'same magnetic structures that spew flares. The Solar Orbiter '
             'will measure magnetic fields on the far side of the sun and test '
             'whether monitoring intense fields before they rotate into view '
             'could improve future predictions. And Parker should improve '
             'space weather models by measuring conditions in the corona as '
             'small flares erupt. Team members are hoping the probe may be '
             'lucky enough to dart through a CME.  But all that is work still '
             "ahead. Congdon's own quest is almost over. The heat shield sits "
             'fastened tightly atop Parker, ready for space. She has booked '
             'her own ticket to Florida for the start of the August launch '
             'window, not to work on it, but to appreciate it as a tourist in '
             'a special viewing area for APL visitors. So has Eugene Parker, '
             'traveling with close family, who will be feted like a VIP.  “The '
             "joy on the scientists' faces—that's what we're looking for,” "

{'abstract': 'Objectives The objective of the present study was to explain why '
             'two siblings carrying both the same homozygous pathogenic '
             'mutation for the autoinflammatory disease hyper IgD syndrome, '
             'show opposite phenotypes, that is, the first being asymptomatic, '
             'the second presenting all classical characteristics of the '
             'disease.  Methods Where single omics (mainly exome) analysis '
             'fails to identify culprit genes/mutations in human complex '
             'diseases, multiomics analyses may provide solutions, although '
             'this has been seldom used in a clinical setting. Here we combine '
             'exome, transcriptome and proteome analyses to decipher at a '
             'molecular level, the phenotypic differences between the two '
             'siblings.  Results This multiomics approach led to the '
             'identification of a single gene —STAT1 —which harboured a rare '
             'missense variant and showed a significant overexpression of both '
             'mRNA and protein in the symptomatic versus the asymptomatic '
             'sister. This variant was shown to be of gain of function nature, '
             'involved in an increased activation of the Janus '
             'kinase/signal\u2009transducer and activator of transcription '
             'signalling (JAK/STAT) pathway, known to play a critical role in '

{'abstract': "Japan's obsession with slender women may harm unborn children "
             'and create long-term health problems for the Japanese '
             'population. Already, a high proportion of Japanese women is '
             'starting pregnancy underweight, and many scientists have '
             "criticized the country's official guidelines for weight gain "
             'during pregnancy as too strict. Now, a survey shows many '
             'pregnant women strive to keep their weight gain below even those '
             'targets. This combination of factors has led to an unusually '
             'high percentage of low-weight births, which is likely the reason '
             'that the height of the average Japanese adult has declined every '
             'year for those born after 1980.  ![Figure][1]  GRAPHIC: N. '

             '10.1136/JECH-2017-209266 (2017), ADAPTED BY J. YOU/ SCIENCE   '
             'The impact could go far beyond height, says perinatal '
             "epidemiologist Naho Morisaki of Japan's National Center for "
             'Child Health and Development in Tokyo, who led the new study. '
             '“Japan may experience an increased disease burden among adults, '
             'and there could be an impact on longevity,” she says. People '
             'born small are more prone to diabetes and hypertension, says '
             'Peter Gluckman, an expert on the developmental origins of health '
             'and disease at The University of Auckland in New Zealand, who '
             "calls the situation “really alarming.” “We've tried very hard to "
             "convince Japan's authorities” to revise the weight gain "
             "recommendations, Gluckman adds. But a spokesperson for Japan's "
             'Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare says there are no plans '
             'to do so.  The shortening of the Japanese is subtle, but '
             'unmistakable. An international study published in 2016 found '
             'that since the late 19th century, the average Japanese adult '
             'male height rose 14.5 centimeters, peaking at 171.5 centimeters '
             'for those born in 1978 and 1979. But by the 1996 birth cohort, '
             'it had dropped to 170.8 centimeters. Over the same period, '
             'average female height jumped 16 centimeters, topped out at 158.5 '
             'centimeters, then dropped by 0.2 centimeters. Some other '
             'countries have also experienced height declines, which the study '
             'variously linked to economic privation, an influx of shorter '
             'immigrants, or—in the United States—poor diet quality, which can '
             'impair growth both in the fetus and in newborn babies.  In '
             'Japan, experts say the evidence for a link with lower birth '
             'weights is strong. As the country recovered from World War II, '
             'the percentage of low–birth weight babies—those weighing 2.5 '
             'kilograms or less at delivery—declined from 7.3% in 1951 to 5.5% '
             'in 1978–79. As babies grew heavier, however, doctors worried '
             'about preeclampsia, a complication that can put the lives of '
             'both mother and baby at risk. In the late 1970s, some Japanese '
             'obstetricians suggested a low-calorie diet could lower that '
             'risk, a view incorporated into 1981 guidelines from the Japan '
             'Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology. “Previously, mothers-to-be '
             'were told to ‘eat for two’; now, the ideal is to ‘give birth '
             'small but raise a big baby,’” says Hideoki Fukuoka, an '
             'obstetrician at Waseda University in Tokyo.  Health ministry '
             'recommendations issued in 1995 also reflected the concerns. The '
             'ministry adapted guidelines for U.S. women, produced by what was '
             'then called the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM), to the smaller '
             'and lighter Japanese population, but in doing so made them '
             'considerably stricter. For underweight women—those with a body '
             'mass index (BMI) below 18.5—IOM guidelines suggest a weight gain '
             'of 12.7 to 18.1 kilograms; Japan set the range at nine to 12 '
             'kilograms.  Japanese women took the advice to heart, and the '
             'percentage of low-weight babies rose to 9.6% in 2010. That this '
             'caused the drop in adult height “is entirely credible and fits '
             'with what we know from [research into] third world nutrition,” '
             'Gluckman says. Morisaki has now confirmed that the desire to '
             'stay slim is exacerbating the trend. Today, more than 20% of '
             'Japanese women in their 20s have BMIs of less than 18.5, '
             'compared with 1.9% of U.S. men and women aged 20 to 39. In a '
             'survey of 1681 pregnant women, 54% said their ideal gestational '
             "weight gain was below the recommendations, Morisaki's team "
             'reports in a paper scheduled to appear online this week in '
             'Scientific Reports.   “The image Japanese mothers-to-be are '
             'striving for is the look of having a basketball in front of them '
             'while the rest of the body is slim,” she says. The survey found '
             'that in addition to a quicker recovery of their prepregnancy '
             'figures, women hope for easier pregnancies and fewer birth '
             'complications. But follow-up surveys found that lower weight '
             'gain did not reduce the risk of cesarian delivery or lead to '
             'faster postpartum weight reduction. And the decline in birth '
             'weights means men born in 2014 will on average grow to be just '
             '170 centimeters tall and women only 157.9 centimeters, '
             'Morisaki’s team projected in a previous study.  Some think the '
             'culture is changing. The media are paying more attention to the '
             'problem of low birth weights, Fukuoka says, and dieticians and '
             'public health groups “are sounding alarms over undernourished '
             'young women.” “There seems to be a trend in the fashion '
             'magazines, going from thinness to sportiness,” Morisaki adds. '
             'The latest government survey shows the percentage of underweight '
             'women in their 20s has dropped slightly since 2013.  On the '
             'other hand, many slender pregnant women still post selfies on '
             'Instagram and share tips on managing weight gain. And most '
             'Japanese obstetricians are opposed to relaxing the weight gain '
             'recommendations, says Shunji Suzuki, an obstetrician at the '
             'Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity Hospital in Tokyo. '
             "Japan's fascination with being thin hasn't quite run its "
             'course.  Correction (2 August 2018): This article has been '
             'updated to correct the proportion of women entering pregnancy '
             'underweight and to clarify a reference to a previous paper.   '

             'human papillomavirus–positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell '
             'carcinoma (OPSCC) following curative therapy. E6/E7 viral '
             'oncoproteins are constitutively expressed in HPV+ tumors and '
             'highly immunogenic, resulting in readily detected serum '
             'antibodies. The purpose of this study is to determine whether '
             'serum E6 and E7 antibody levels can potentially serve as a '
             'biomarker of recurrence in patients with HPV+OPSCC.  '
             'Experimental Design: We evaluated E6/E7 antibody levels in '
             'patients with previously untreated, advanced stage (III, IVa-b), '
             'HPV+OPSCC receiving definitive chemoradiation under a uniform '
             'protocol from 2003 to 2010. Baseline and longitudinal serum '
             'samples were obtained from our archived repository. E6/E7 serum '
             'levels were measured using a glutathione- S -transferase capture '
             'ELISA and quantified by approximating the area under the '
             'dilution curve, and were analyzed using ANOVA and linear mixed '

             'people weighing 50–69 kg (hazard ratio [HR] 0·75 [95% CI '
             '0·65–0·85]) but not in those weighing 70 kg or more (0·95 '
             '[0·86–1·04]; 1·09 [0·93–1·29] for vascular death). Furthermore, '
             'the case fatality of a first cardiovascular event was increased '
             'by low-dose aspirin in people weighing 70 kg or more (odds ratio '
             '1·33 [95% CI 1·08–1·64], p=0·0082). Higher doses of aspirin '
             '(≥325 mg) had the opposite interaction with bodyweight '
             '(difference pinteraction=0·0013), reducing cardiovascular events '
             'only at higher weight (pinteraction=0·017). Findings were '
             'similar in men and women, in people with diabetes, in trials of '

             'Aspirin-mediated reductions in long-term risk of colorectal '

             'Stratification by body size also revealed harms due to excess '
             'dosing: risk of sudden death was increased by aspirin in people '
             'at low weight for dose (pinteraction=0·0018) and risk of '
             'all-cause death was increased in people weighing less than 50 kg '
             'who were receiving 75–100 mg aspirin (HR 1·52 [95% CI '

             'the 3-year risk of cancer was also increased by aspirin (1·20 '
             '[1·03–1·47], p=0·02), particularly in those weighing less than '

             '(75–100 mg) were only effective in preventing vascular events in '

{'abstract': 'Living on an island can have strange effects. On Cyprus, hippos '
             'dwindled to the size of sea lions. On Flores in Indonesia, '
             'extinct elephants weighed no more than a large hog, but rats '
             'grew as big as cats. All are examples of the so-called island '
             'effect, which holds that when food and predators are scarce, big '
             'animals shrink and little ones grow. But no one was sure whether '
             'the same rule explains the most famous example of dwarfing on '
             'Flores, the odd extinct hominin called the hobbit, which lived '
             '60,000 to 100,000 years ago and stood about a meter tall.  Now, '
             'genetic evidence from modern pygmies on Flores—who are unrelated '
             'to the hobbit—confirms that humans, too, are subject to '
             'so-called island dwarfing. On p. [511][1], an international team '
             'reports that Flores pygmies differ from their closest relatives '
             'on New Guinea and in East Asia in carrying more gene variants '
             'that promote short stature. The genetic differences testify to '
             'recent evolution—the island rule at work. And they imply that '
             'the same force gave the hobbit its short stature, the authors '
             'say.  “Flores is a magical place where things go and get small,” '
             'says population geneticist Joshua Akey at Princeton University, '
             'a co-author of the study. “This is the only example in the world '
             'where insular dwarfism has arisen twice in hominins.”  Princeton '
             'postdoc Serena Tucci set out to study the Rampasasa pygmies of '
             'Flores, who average just 145 centimeters tall. Famed Indonesian '
             'paleoanthropologist Teuku Jacob, now deceased, had '
             'controversially proposed that the Rampasasa people inherited '
             'some traits from the hobbit, whom he thought was a modern human. '
             "To explore the pygmies' ancestry, Tucci and her then-adviser, Ed "
             'Green of the University of California (UC), Santa Cruz, traveled '
             "to Flores. With the pygmies' permission, they began a “model” "
             'collaboration with Indonesian researchers, says molecular '
             'biologist and co-author Herawati Sudoyo of the Eijkman Institute '
             'for Molecular Biology in Jakarta. Her colleagues gathered spit '
             'and blood from 32 people and extracted the DNA. Then, Eijkman '
             "researcher Gludhug Purnomo hand-carried samples to Green's lab, "
             'where he helped sequence 2.5 million single nucleotide '
             'polymorphisms, or alleles, in every individual, plus 10 complete '
             'genomes.  The team found no trace of archaic DNA that could be '
             'from the hobbit. Instead, the pygmies were most closely related '
             'to other East Asians. The DNA suggested that their ancestors '
             'came to Flores in several waves: in the past 50,000 years or so, '
             'when modern humans first reached Melanesia; and in the past 5000 '
             'years, when settlers came from both East Asia and New Guinea.  '
             "The pygmies' genomes also reflect an environmental shift. They "
             'carry an ancient version of a gene that encodes enzymes to break '
             'down fatty acids in meat and seafood. It suggests their '
             'ancestors underwent a “big shift in diet” after reaching Flores, '
             'perhaps eating pygmy elephants or marine foods, says population '
             'geneticist Rasmus Nielsen of UC Berkeley, who was not part of '
             "the study.  The pygmies' genomes are also rich in alleles that "
             'data from the UK Biobank have linked to short stature. Other '
             'East Asians have the same height-reducing alleles, but at much '
             'lower frequencies. This suggests natural selection favored '
             "existing genes for shortness while the pygmies' ancestors were "
             "on Flores. “We can't say for sure that they got shorter on "
             "Flores, but what makes this convincing is they're comparing the "
             'Flores population to other East Asian populations of similar '
             'ancestry,” says population geneticist Iain Mathieson of the '
             'University of Pennsylvania.  The discovery fits with a recent '
             'study suggesting evolution also favored short stature in people '
             'on the Andaman Islands, Green says. Such selection on islands '
             'boosts the theory that the hobbit, too, was once a taller '
             'species, who dwindled in height over millennia on Flores.  “If '

{'abstract': 'July 28 is World Hepatitis Day, which this year is commemorated '
             'by a series of events in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where great '
             'progress has been made in scaling up hepatitis testing and '
             'treatment, offering a model for other countries to follow. '
             'Globally, the aim of the day is to support hepatitis prevention, '
             'testing, treatment, and care services, showcase best practices, '
             'and develop partnerships and funding. In 2015, 71 million people '
             'were estimated by WHO to have chronic hepatitis C infection.As '
             'part of the events for World Hepatitis Day, on July 26, WHO '
             'released new guidelines for the care and treatment of people '
             'with hepatitis C infection, updating their 2016 recommendations. '
             'The new guidelines strongly recommend offering treatment to all '
             'people aged 12 years and older (except pregnant women) who have '
             'chronic hepatitis C infection, irrespective of disease stage. '
             'Treatment regimens that can cure all six major subtypes of '
             'hepatitis C infection are recommended, including the use of '
             'direct-acting antivirals, which have become available since '
             '2016. These new “treat all” guidelines remove the need for '
             'expensive genotyping to determine the best treatment for the '
             'specific strain of the virus, simplify treatment, and enable '
             'task shifting so that non-specialised health-care workers can '
             'deliver care.New too is the guidance on treating adolescents and '
             'children older than 12 years. Two specific direct-acting '
             'antiviral regimens are recommended for those aged between 12 and '
             '17 years, with pangenotypic direct-acting antivirals recommended '
             'for those aged 18 years and older. In children younger than 12 '
             'years with chronic hepatitis C infection, treatment is not '
             'recommended, although the guidelines recognise that the evidence '
             'here is poor. Trials are ongoing in this age group.The continued '
             'price reduction of direct-acting antivirals means that rolling '
             'out treatment for all can be cost effective, while also reducing '
             'deaths, preventing liver cancer development, and reducing new '
             'infection rates. It is fair to say that the development and '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: The primary cause of death due to head and neck '
             'squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is local treatment failure. The '
             'goal of this study was to examine this phenomenon using an '
             'unbiased approach.  Experimental Design: We utilized human '
             'papilloma virus (HPV)-negative cell lines rendered '
             'radiation-resistant (RR) via repeated exposure to radiation, a '
             'panel of HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines and three cohorts of '
             'HPV-negative HNSCC tumors ( n = 68, 97, and 114) from patients '
             'treated with radiotherapy and subjected to genomic, '
             'transcriptomic, and proteomic analysis.  Results: RR cell lines '
             'exhibited upregulation of several proteins compared with '
             'controls, including increased activation of Axl and PI3 kinase '
             'signaling as well as increased expression of PD-L1. '
             'Additionally, inhibition of either Axl or PI3 kinase led to '
             'decreased PD-L1 expression. When clinical samples were subjected '
             'to RPPA and mRNA expression analysis, PD-L1 was correlated with '
             'both Axl and PI3K signaling as well as dramatically associated '
             'with local failure following radiotherapy. This finding was '
             'confirmed examining a third cohort using immunohistochemistry. '
             'Indeed, tumors with high expression of PD-L1 had failure rates '
             'following radiotherapy of 60%, 70%, and 50% compared with 20%, '
             '25%, and 20% in the PD-L1–low expression group ( P = 0.01, 1.9 × '
             '10−3, and 9 × 10−4, respectively). This finding remained '
             'significant on multivariate analysis in all groups. '
             'Additionally, patients with PD-L1 low/CD8+ tumor-infiltrating '
             'lymphocytes high had no local failure or death due to disease ( '

             'In 2015, UNAIDS set a goal to “end AIDS as a public health '
             'threat” by 2030. The campaign rests on a mathematical model that '
             'says the epidemic will peter out if enough people keep the virus '
             'in check. To pull it off, by 2020, at least 90% of the nearly 37 '
             'million people in the world living with HIV must know their '
             'status, 90% of them must start treatment, and 90% of treated '
             'people must stay on the medication and keep the virus fully '
             'suppressed.  To date, few countries have achieved 90-90-90; '
             'worldwide, 21.7 million people are now receiving treatment, well '
             'short of the number required to meet the 2030 goal. With 1.8 '
             'million new infections last year, the world seems unlikely to '
             'reduce new infections to 500,000 by 2020, the UNAIDS benchmark, '
             'Sidibé said at the meeting.  Several factors contribute to the '

             '2017—is 20% short of the 2020 benchmark, and there were “no new '
             'significant commitments” from donors last year. Stigma and '
             'discrimination remain obstacles to testing and treatment, and '
             'prevention efforts such as condom promotion and pre-exposure '
             'prophylaxis have received short shrift.  A commission of 40 '
             'leading HIV/AIDS researchers contends that the end AIDS campaign '
             'itself may have contributed to the problem. In the 28 July issue '
             'of The Lancet , the group, co-chaired by Beyrer, wrote, the '
             '“prevailing discourse on ending AIDS has bred a dangerous '
             'complacency and may have hastened the weakening of global '
             'resolve to combat HIV.” In particular, the report highlights '
             'what it calls an “overwhelming emphasis on HIV treatment” that '
             'has led to “chronic underfunding of HIV prevention.”  Some '
             'prominent researchers have questioned whether 90-90-90 will lead '
             'to the hoped-for drops in new infections ( Science , 1 July '
             '2016, p. [18][2]). But the strategy can work, and Namibia '
             'reported the most compelling data yet of its power. A southern '
             'African country with 2.3 million people and 12% HIV prevalence, '
             'Namibia exceeded the 90-90-90 target, reported Minister of '
             'Health and Social Services Bernard Haufiku, and new infection '
             'rates in the past 2 years have dropped by 40%. Namibia provides '
             '“clear evidence” that 90-90-90 works, said Deborah Birx, who '
             "heads the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief "
             '(PEPFAR) in Washington, D.C., a major donor to the country. '
             'Unfortunately, Birx says, some other PEPFAR “focus countries” '
             'have fallen short of the mark (see graph), which ultimately '
             'calls for viral suppression in 73% of infected people. (Multiply '
             '90% times three.)  Neighboring Botswana, another major PEPFAR '
             'recipient, also has solid evidence that large-scale viral '
             'suppression curbs spread. In one of the largest studies to '
             'evaluate treatment as prevention, the Botswana Combination '
             'Prevention Project compared 15 communities in which every '
             'infected person received treatment immediately with 15 others '
             'where they received treatment only after there was evidence of '
             'immune damage, the standard of care when the study began in '
             '2013. (Botswana began to treat everyone in 2016.) Each group had '
             'more than 4000 infected people, and fewer new infections '
             'occurred in the aggressively treated arm—57 versus 90, a 30% '
             'drop, reported Moeketsi Joseph Makhema from the Botswana Harvard '
             'AIDS Institute Partnership in Gaborone.  Another study showed '
             'that fully suppressing HIV with drugs virtually eliminates the '
             'risk of transmission. Epidemiologist Alison Rodger of University '
             'College London and colleagues followed 783 gay couples in which '
             'only one partner was infected at the outset. The men reported '
             '76,991 instances of anal sex without a condom, yet only 15 of '
             'them became infected. Genome analysis of their newly acquired '
             'viruses indicated that in every case, the men had become '
             'infected through sex with someone other than the treated '
             "partner. If the infected partner is on treatment, “You'd have to "
             'have condomless sex for 419 years to have even one '
             'transmission,” Rodger said.  Powerful as treatment is at '
             'preventing spread, epidemiologist Peter Piot, head of the London '
             'School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, stressed that it can only '
             'work if countries and donors meet the huge challenge of keeping '
             "tens of millions of people on lifelong treatment. AIDS won't "
             "truly end until there's a vaccine, he said, and in the meantime "
             'the epidemic could rebound. “International solidarity and '
             "funding will be necessary for decades to come. Let's not fool "
             'ourselves.”   [1]: pending:yes  [2]: '

             'There is increasing evidence that a closed-loop delivery system '
             '(artificial pancreas) can improve glucose control in patients '
             'with type 1 diabetes. We wanted to investigate whether a '
             'closed-loop system could also improve glycemic control in '
             'patients with type 2 diabetes who were receiving noncritical '
             'care.MethodsIn this randomized, open-label trial conducted on '
             'general wards in two tertiary hospitals located in the United '
             'Kingdom and Switzerland, we assigned 136 adults with type 2 '
             'diabetes who required subcutaneous insulin therapy to receive '
             'either closed-loop insulin delivery (70 patients) or '
             'conventional subcutaneous insulin therapy, according to local '
             'clinical practice (66 patients). The primary end point was the '
             'percentage of time that the sensor glucose measurement was '
             'within the target range of 100 to 180 mg per deciliter (5.6 to '
             '10.0 mmol per liter) for up to 15 days or until hospital '
             'discharge.ResultsThe mean (±SD) percentage of time that the '
             'sensor glucose measurement was in the target range was '
             '65.8±16.8% in the closed-loop group and 41.5±16.9% in the '
             'control group, a difference of 24.3±2.9 percentage points (95% '
             'confidence interval [CI], 18.6 to 30.0; P<0.001); values above '
             'the target range were found in 23.6±16.6% and 49.5±22.8% of the '
             'patients, respectively, a difference of 25.9±3.4 percentage '
             'points (95% CI, 19.2 to 32.7; P<0.001). The mean glucose level '
             'was 154 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter) in the closed-loop '
             'group and 188 mg per deciliter (10.4 mmol per liter) in the '
             'control group (P<0.001). There was no significant between-group '

             'sensor glucose measurement of <54 mg per deciliter; P=0.80) or '
             'in the amount of insulin that was delivered (median dose, 44.4 U '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Androgen receptor (AR) expression has been observed in '
             'about 70% of patients with breast cancer, but its prognostic '
             'role remains uncertain.  Experimental Design: To assess the '
             'prognostic role of AR expression in early-stage breast cancer, '
             'we performed a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the '
             'impact of AR at the protein and gene expression level on '
             'disease-free survival (DFS) and/or overall survival (OS). '
             'Eligible studies were identified by systematic review of '
             'electronic databases using the MeSH-terms “breast neoplasm” and '
             '“androgen receptor” and were selected after a qualitative '
             'assessment based on the REMARK criteria. A pooled gene '
             'expression analysis of 35 publicly available microarray data '
             'sets was also performed from patients with early-stage breast '
             'cancer with available gene expression and clinical outcome '

             'clinical meta-analysis, including 10,004 patients, were '
             'considered as evaluable for the current study after the '
             'qualitative assessment. AR positivity defined by IHC was '

             '0.38–0.73, P < 0.001]. Thirty-five datasets including 7,220 '
             'patients were eligible for the pooled gene expression analysis. '
             'High AR mRNA levels were found to confer positive prognosis '

{'abstract': 'If you want a no-fuss, no-muss pet, consider the Bengalese '
             'finch. Dubbed the society finch for its friendliness, breeders '
             'often use it to foster unrelated chicks. But put the piebald '
             'songbird next to its wild ancestor, the white-rumped munia, and '
             'you can both see and hear the differences: The aggressive munia '
             'tends to be darker and whistles a scratchy, off-kilter tune, '
             'whereas the pet finch warbles a melody so complex that even '
             'nonmusicians may wonder how this caged bird learned to sing.  '
             'All this makes the domesticated and wild birds a perfect natural '
             'experiment to help explore an upstart proposal about human '
             'evolution: that the building blocks of language are a byproduct '
             'of brain alterations that arose when natural selection favored '
             'cooperation among early humans. According to this hypothesis, '
             'skills such as learning complex calls, combining vocalizations, '
             'and simply knowing when another creature wants to communicate '
             'all came about as a consequence of pro-social traits like '
             'kindness. If so, domesticated animals, which are bred to be '
             'good-natured, might exhibit such communication skills too.  The '
             'idea is rooted in a much older one: that humans tamed '
             'themselves. This self-domestication hypothesis, which got its '
             'start with Charles Darwin, says that when early humans started '
             'to prefer cooperative friends and mates to aggressive ones, they '
             'essentially domesticated themselves ( Science , 24 October 2014, '
             'p. [405][1]). Along with tameness came evolutionary changes seen '
             'in other domesticated mammals—smoother brows, shorter faces, and '
             'more feminized features—thanks in part to lower levels of '
             'circulating androgens (such as testosterone) that tend to '
             'promote aggression.  Higher levels of neurohormones such as '
             'serotonin were also part of the domestication package. Such '
             "pro-social hormones help us infer others' mental states, learn "
             'through joint attention, and even link objects and labels—all '
             'prerequisites for language, says developmental psychologist '
             'Michael Tomasello of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, '
             'who studies social cognition.  In recent papers and at Evolang, '
             'a biannual conference on language evolution held here this '
             'spring, researchers turned to birds, foxes, and bonobos to help '
             'understand how domestication may have paved the way for '
             'language. Constantina Theofanopoulou, a neuroscientist at the '
             'University of Barcelona in Spain who convened the Evolang '
             'workshop, calls it the “most promising” working hypothesis to '
             'account for the thorny problem of language evolution, because it '
             '“puts together evidence from different levels of biological '
             'analysis: the anatomical, the brain, the endocrine system, and '
             'behavior.”  In his talk at Evolang, ornithologist Kazuo Okanoya '
             'of the Riken Center for Brain Science in Wako, Japan, focused on '
             'the munia and the Bengalese finch, which people domesticated '
             'some 250 years ago. Both birds are vocal learners, a rare trait '
             'that lets them pick up calls from adult tutors—as do parrots, '
             'hummingbirds, and humans. But their songs are wildly different, '
             'as Okanoya demonstrated by whistling examples of each.  He then '
             'presented data quantifying what the audience had heard: Munia '
             'songs tend to be shorter, simpler, and full of unmelodic '
             'segments of acoustic “noise,” compared with the longer, louder '
             'finch songs, which contain peeps, chirps, and segments that '
             'often repeat and recombine in improvisational ways.  '

             'STOCK PHOTO  Okanoya says the differences likely arose from '
             "domestication, in particular the finches' relatively stress-free "
             "environment. He's shown that the finches have lower fecal levels "
             'of corticosterone—a hormone that boosts aggressiveness and '
             'blunts cognitive functioning in birds—than the munia. In his '
             'talk, Okanoya reported that high corticosterone levels inhibit '
             "the growth of neurons in the birds' song-learning system, which "
             'is larger in the finches than in the munia.  Thus, Okanoya '
             'hypothesizes, selection for tameness and gregariousness by pet '
             "owners boosted the finches' capacity for complex song. And "
             'because attention-getting songs help advertise fitness to '
             'females, the males best at learning and singing would be most '
             'likely to pass their genes on to the next generation, sparking '
             'further complexity.  ![Figure][2]  The society finch loves to '
             'socialize with other birds, and sings a complex, melodic song.  '
             'PHOTO: STUART HOUGH/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO  If early humans somehow '
             'developed their own lower-stress “domesticated” '
             'environment—perhaps as a result of easier access to food—it '
             'could have fostered more cooperation and reduced aggression, '
             'speculates evolutionary linguist Simon Kirby, writing with James '
             'Thomas, both of The University of Edinburgh, in a recent paper '
             'in Biology & Philosophy. As with the finch, a mellow environment '
             'may have allowed for an expanded role for learning, including in '
             'language acquisition.  Kirby and Thomas point out another analog '
             'for humans: domesticated foxes. In a famous experiment, Russian '
             'geneticist Dmitry Belyaev and colleagues selected for tameness '
             'among captured Siberian silver foxes starting in the 1950s. If a '
             'wild fox did not attack a human hand placed into its cage, it '
             'was bred. Over 50 generations, the foxes came to look like other '
             'domesticated species, with shorter faces, curly tails, and '
             'lighter coloring—traits that have since been linked to shifts in '
             'prenatal hormones.  Unlike their wild counterparts, tame foxes '
             'came to understand the importance of human pointing and gazing, '
             'Thomas and Kirby note. That ability to “mind read” is key to '
             "language. Thus, even though the foxes don't vocalize in complex "
             'ways, they show that selection only for tameness can carry '
             'communication skills in its wake.  At Evolang, other researchers '
             'zeroed in on bonobos, great apes that show some signs of '
             'self-domestication, including low levels of aggression and '
             'sensitivity to the gaze of others. According to Zanna Clay, a '
             'primatologist at Durham University in the United Kingdom, '
             'bonobos also display a building block of early language: Instead '
             'of sticking to a fixed repertoire of “inherited” calls, they can '
             'improvise.  Clay and her colleagues have assembled hundreds of '
             'recordings from 18 bonobos in the wild and in zoos, showing that '
             'individuals combine set types of calls in distinct ways for '
             'different situations. She hypothesizes that self-domestication '
             'may have helped shape this communicative flexibility.  Stronger '
             'proof may come from genetic studies. Theofanopoulou and her team '
             'recently scoured the scientific literature for genes that differ '
             'between wild and domesticated species—cats, dogs, horses, and '
             'cattle—and that also show signs of being selected in the '
             'domesticated animals. The team did the same for modern humans '
             'and what they considered our nearest wild stand-ins, '
             'Neanderthals and Denisovans.  Then, the researchers looked for '
             'genes that may have evolved in the same way in more than one '
             'wild-domesticated pair. There were more than three dozen, many '
             'linked to brain plasticity, learning, and the development of the '
             'nervous system, the team reported late last year in PLOS ONE. '
             'Some, such as the gene for a receptor for the neurotransmitter '
             'glutamate, are linked to processes that could shape a '
             "language-ready brain. But there's no clear path yet from these "
             'genes to their function—or to the sweeping changes linked to '
             'domestication, cautions Antonio Benítez-Burraco, a linguist at '
             'the University of Seville in Spain.  Tomasello also cautions '
             'against trying to explain human language solely from animal '
             'models. “I think humans were selected to actually collaborate,” '
             'not just to get rid of aggression, he says. “[That] '
             'fundamentally cooperative motive … is a precursor to uniquely '
             'human communication.”   [1]: '

{'abstract': 'Last week, plant physiologist Stefan Jansson of Umeå University '
             'in Sweden emailed the Swedish Board of Agriculture a question '
             'about the gene-edited cabbage plant blooming in his backyard. In '
             'a landmark ruling on 25 July, the Court of Justice of the '
             'European Union in Luxembourg had decided that gene-edited plants '
             'should go through the same extensive regulatory process as '
             'earlier generations of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). '
             "Had Jansson's cabbage, produced in a colleague's lab, suddenly "
             'become illicit?  The first response was an automated email '
             'saying agency staff were on holiday and would get back to him in '
             'August. “Then I got an email back saying: ‘OK, we need to '
             'consider this carefully,’” Jansson says.  Similar scenes were '
             'playing out elsewhere in the European Union last week. Caught '
             'off guard by the midsummer decision, regulatory authorities in '
             'the United Kingdom and Belgium were faced with the question of '
             'what to do with field trials already approved and underway. But '
             "the verdict's impact will go far beyond current trials. Many "
             'researchers say it will have a chilling effect on plant biotech. '
             'Long skeptical of such technologies, Europe has largely shunned '
             'transgenic crops; now, it is set to lose out on another '
             'technological revolution, those researchers say. The decision '
             'could also hamper basic science and might impede international '
             "trade. “We're not yet able to gauge the full scope of its "
             'ramifications,” says Detlef Bartsch, who leads the Department of '
             "Genetic Engineering at Germany's Federal Office of Consumer "
             'Protection and Food Safety in Berlin.  ![Figure][1]  A European '
             'court ruled that gene-edited plants should be regulated just '
             'like traditional transgenic crops.  PHOTO: MICHAEL '
             'GOTTSCHALK/PHOTOTHEK/GETTY IMAGES  The ruling determines how EU '
             'countries should deal with the products of revolutionary '
             'gene-editing techniques such as CRISPR. Unlike traditional '
             'genetic modification, in which entire genes are transferred from '
             'one species to the next, gene editing allows scientists to make '
             'very precise and subtle genetic changes. In the European Union, '
             'traditional GMOs are regulated by a 2001 directive that requires '
             'an assessment of risks to health and the environment before the '
             'crops can be released, as well as elaborate labeling, tracking, '
             'and monitoring. The directive exempts some techniques, including '
             'mutagenesis—the use of chemicals or radiation to create '
             'mutations for plant breeding—that “have a long safety record.”  '
             'Scientists had argued that gene-edited plants should also be '
             'exempted because their creation more closely resembles '
             'mutagenesis, and the French government took the same position, '
             'sparing gene-edited crops from the strict rules of the 2001 '
             'directive. Environmental groups challenged that decision in '
             '2014, arguing that gene-edited crops carry the same health and '
             'environmental risks as other GMOs and should be treated equally. '
             "France's Council of State asked the Court of Justice for "
             'guidance.  The court decided that CRISPR and other gene-editing '
             'tools should not fall under the exemption because they “alter '
             'the genetic material of an organism in a way that does not occur '
             'naturally.” It agreed the new techniques could be no less risky '
             'than traditional genetic engineering.  Some nongovernmental '
             'organizations (NGOs) called the decision a victory. “I think it '
             'would have been way too drastic to completely exempt all these '
             'techniques from the legislation,” says Nina Holland from '
             'Corporate Europe Observatory, a Brussels-based watchdog. “It '
             'would have left large holes in environmental and consumer '
             'protection.” But scientists were dismayed. “I find the decision '
             'depressing, a huge step backwards,” says Johnathan Napier, a '
             'plant biotechnologist at Rothamsted Research, a nonprofit '
             'agricultural research center in Harpenden, U.K. Gene editing '
             'promises a cheaper, easier route to create crops with new '
             'traits, but the court decision will make it prohibitively '
             'expensive to bring those crops to the market, he predicts, so '
             'companies will bow out, just as they have done with traditional '
             'GMOs. “It is going to do exactly the opposite of what the '
             'European Commission is trying to do, which is to try and have '
             'impact and translatable research.”  The U.S. government, which '
             'has allowed some gene-edited plants on the market with no '
             'regulation, voiced its displeasure as well. “Government policies '
             'should encourage scientific innovation without creating '
             'unnecessary barriers or unjustifiably stigmatizing new '
             'technologies,” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said '
             'in a written statement that called the 2001 regulations '
             '“regressive and outdated.” But the decision could benefit U.S. '
             'science if European researchers decide to seek a more welcoming '
             'home for their studies, Napier says. “It just means that we are '
             'going to export good ideas and good people to go and work in '
             'more favorable territories.”  Napier is one of the scientists '
             'whose work is now in limbo. At Rothamsted, he has been growing '
             'Camelina , an oilseed crop, edited to lack an enzyme that '
             "converts oleic acid into linoleic acid. It's a possible step in "
             'the creation of plants that churn out omega-3 fatty acids, which '
             'have human health benefits. Created by French scientists, the '
             'plants were growing at Rothamsted because the U.K. Department '
             'for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) had given field '
             "trials a green light. Now, “We're sort of sitting and waiting "
             'for DEFRA to provide advice,” Napier says. (Whether the United '
             'Kingdom might become more welcoming to gene editing after Brexit '
             "remains to be seen; the U.K. government's most recent position "
             'paper makes the case for complete alignment with the European '
             'Union in agriculture.)  Scientists say the ruling may be '
             'impossible to enforce because it is hard to distinguish '
             'gene-edited plants from their natural counterparts. Techniques '
             'like CRISPR leave few traces in the genome of an edited plant; a '
             'small deletion may be impossible to pick out amid numerous '
             'natural changes, Jansson says. (The whole genes spliced into the '
             'genome of classical GMOs, by contrast, are easy to spot.) '
             'Jansson, for one, refuses to say what gene was deleted in his '
             "cabbage: “If I don't tell you, you cannot find out,” he says.  "
             'This may not always hold true, however. Camelina is a hexaploid '
             'species, meaning there are six copies of each gene; having the '
             'same change in all six—something highly unlikely to occur in '
             'nature—would be a sign of gene editing, Napier says. In fact, '
             'Holland predicts the need to enforce the decision will spur '
             'research into new ways to detect gene editing.  Basic plant '
             'science may suffer, however. Detlef Weigel, director at the Max '
             'Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany, '
             'is studying how various genetic changes can help plants adapt to '
             'climate change—and he needs to grow them outside, he says. '
             '“Again and again we have seen that there are big differences '
             'between the results we get in a greenhouse and in a field, even '
             'if we use the same earth and sprinkle the plants with '
             'rainwater.” Weigel tested some edited plants in a field in '
             'Sweden this year. “Luckily we harvested the plants a few weeks '
             'ago,” because the cumbersome permitting process will now make '
             'such research impractical, he says. “If we want to test a single '
             'mutant in the field, it will cost us about €500 to create that '
             'plant, and then about €250,000 to get the permit to grow it in a '
             'field.”  Joyce Tait, who directs the Institute for Innovation '
             'Generation in the Life Sciences at The University of Edinburgh, '
             "says she understands scientists' frustration. “But I also feel "
             'the current gene-editing technology does enable you to make '
             'changes that are so significant that to claim ‘this must be safe '
             'because it is natural’ is stretching the evidence-based risk '
             "analysis,” she says. She thinks Europe's regulatory system "
             'should focus on evaluating the risks of individual plants rather '
             'than the method that produced them. “If Europe sticks with the '
             'current system and the way it has operated the past 20, 30 '
             'years, I think it will become increasingly separated from the '
             'rest of the world,” Tait says.  But the European ruling could '
             'also affect the rest of the world, she adds. The Cartagena '
             'Protocol on Biosafety, a supplement to the Convention on '
             'Biological Diversity, details when countries can ban certain '
             'agricultural imports for safety reasons. The European Union, a '
             'signatory to the protocol, has so far argued against including '
             'gene editing. “That could change now,” Tait says, opening the '
             'way for countries around the world, including in Europe, to '
             'block imports of gene-edited crops. “It will certainly not make '
             'the trade between Europe and other parts of the world easier,” '
             "Bartsch says.  Another question is whether Europe's conservative "
             'approach will reverberate in developing countries. “A lot of '
             'these countries have a much more positive inclination to these '
             'new technologies, because there are so many potential benefits,” '
             'Tait says. “But there is a strong campaign by NGOs to stop this '
             'next generation of technology from taking off in agriculture.”   '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: In breast cancer models, combination epigenetic therapy '
             'with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and a histone deacetylase '
             'inhibitor led to reexpression of genes encoding important '
             'therapeutic targets, including the estrogen receptor (ER). We '
             'conducted a multicenter phase II study of 5-azacitidine and '
             'entinostat in women with advanced hormone-resistant or '
             'triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).  Experimental Design: '
             'Patients received 5-azacitidine 40 mg/m2 (days 1–5, 8–10) and '
             'entinostat 7 mg (days 3, 10) on a 28-day cycle. Continuation of '
             'epigenetic therapy was offered with the addition of endocrine '
             'therapy at the time of progression [optional continuation (OC) '
             'phase]. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in '
             'each cohort. We hypothesized that ORR would be ≥20% against null '
             'of 5% using Simon two-stage design. At least one response was '
             'required in 1 of 13 patients per cohort to continue accrual to '
             '27 per cohort (type I error, 4%; power, 90%).  Results: There '
             'was one partial response among 27 women with hormone-resistant '
             'disease (ORR = 4%; 95% CI, 0–19), and none in 13 women with '
             'TNBC. One additional partial response was observed in the OC '
             'phase in the hormone-resistant cohort ( n = 12). Mandatory tumor '
             'samples were obtained pre- and posttreatment (58% paired) with '
             'either up- or downregulation of ER observed in approximately 50% '
             'of posttreatment biopsies in the hormone-resistant, but not TNBC '
             'cohort.  Conclusions: Combination epigenetic therapy was well '
             'tolerated, but our primary endpoint was not met. OC phase '
             'results suggest that some women benefit from epigenetic therapy '
             'and/or reintroduction of endocrine therapy beyond progression, '
             'but further study is needed. Clin Cancer Res; 23(11); 2691–701. '

             'the blood of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but '
             'little is known about the exact phenotype of these cells. We '
             'assessed expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), CD133, and '

             'phenotype in patients with PDAC and the relationship of this '
             'expression to patient outcomes.  Experimental Design: Peripheral '
             'blood from 60 consecutive patients with PDAC undergoing surgical '
             'resection was obtained and processed using the Isolation by Size '
             'of Epithelial Tumor (ISET) method. Immunofluorescence was used '
             'to identify CTCs expressing cytokeratin, CD133, CD44, and ALDH.  '
             'Results: Forty-seven patients (78%) had epithelial CTCs staining '
             'positive for pan-cytokeratin and at least one TIC marker. '
             'Forty-six patients (77%) had epithelial CTCs that labeled with '
             'antibodies to cytokeratin and ALDH. By separate analysis, 34 '
             '(57%) had cytokeratin-positive, CD133-positive, and '
             'CD44-positive (triple-positive) CTCs, whereas 40 (67%) had '
             'cytokeratin-positive, CD133-positive, CD44-negative CTCs. The '
             'remaining 13 patients did not have CTCs, as defined by '
             'cytokeratin expression. ALDH-positive CTCs and triple-positive '
             'CTCs were significantly associated with worse survival by '
             'univariate analysis, even when accounting for other significant '
             'prognostic factors (all, P ≤ 0.01). ALDH-positive CTCs, '
             'triple-positive CTCs, and dual cytokeratin- and CD133-positive '
             'CTCs were independent predictors of tumor recurrence by logistic '

{'abstract': 'Objectives While new treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) '
             'have markedly improved disease control by targeting '

{'abstract': 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by the '
             'inability of the insulin-producing β-cells to overcome insulin '
             'resistance. We previously identified an imprinted region on '
             'chromosome 14, the DLK1 - MEG3 locus, as being down-regulated in '
             'human T2D islets. Here, using targeted epigenetic modifiers, we '
             'prove that increased methylation at the promoter of Meg3 in '
             'mouse βTC6 β-cells results in decreased transcription of the '
             'maternal transcripts associated with this locus. As a result, '
             'the sensitivity of β-cells to cytokine-mediated oxidative stress '
             'was increased. Additionally, we demonstrate that an '
             'evolutionarily conserved intronic region at the MEG3 locus can '
             'function as an enhancer in βTC6 β-cells. Using circular '
             'chromosome conformation capture followed by high-throughput '
             'sequencing, we demonstrate that the promoter of MEG3 physically '
             'interacts with this novel enhancer and other putative regulatory '
             'elements in this imprinted region in human islets. Remarkably, '
             'this enhancer is bound in an allele-specific manner by the '

{'abstract': "Philosophically interrogating peoples' motives and aims in "
             'matters of procreation leads to controversy and emotionally '
             'charged debates. Introducing ideas about genome editing and its '
             'implications broadens discussions about human reproduction from '
             'fertility clinics and prospective parents to organisations and '
             'governments worldwide. 40 years after the first baby was born by '
             'in-vitro fertilisation, the game changing technique of '
             'CRISPR-Cas9, which enables precise alterations of DNA sequences '
             'in living cells, has once again sparked heated argument about '
             'the use of interventions selecting for traits and against '
             'diseases of human beings.Drawing on law, bioethics, sociology, '
             'medical genetics, and biology, among other fields, the UK '
             'Nuffield Council of Bioethics, in a report published on July 17, '
             'finds that heritable genome editing interventions should be used '
             'in some situations. It expands on this conclusion to say that '
             'there are no absolute ethical objections that would rule these '
             'interventions out in all circumstances, for all time. If this is '
             'the case, and they argue it is, there are moral reasons to '
             'continue with the present lines of research to identify the '
             'conditions under which heritable genome editing interventions '
             'would be permissible.People will continue to want to be parents. '
             'Furthermore, some will desire their children to be genetically '
             'related to them. However, the growing knowledge of '
             'genomics—including an understanding of loci contributing to both '
             'general observable traits and specific diseases—could present '
             'prospective parents with increasingly complex decisions. The '
             'report highlights that choosing the genetic characteristics of '
             "one's offspring has implications for the psychological and "
             'social identity of the resulting person. Picking a preferred '
             'genetic profile by would-be parents might be seen to be '
             'offending the essential dignity and nature of the person as a '
             'free and independent human being able to enjoy equal civil '
             'rights. Furthermore, decisions made by prospective parents in '
             'this context will have implications not only for their offspring '
             "but for their offsprings' offspring.There are warnings too. "
             'Safety concerns about the use of CRISPR-Cas9 have recently been '
             'raised after researchers identified genomic damage in regions '
             'unrelated to the cut site in a study on mouse stem cells, mouse '
             'haematopoietic progenitors, and human differentiated cell '
             'lines.These new opportunities and concerns about genome editing '
             "are expected to produce a quantum shift in society's beliefs "
             'about normal reproduction and reproductive behaviours, say the '
             "report's authors. Genome editing might also bestow unequitable "
             'benefits with socially advantageous genetically conditioned '
             'characteristics becoming concentrated in certain groups or '
             'families.Few might lament the elimination of many inherited '
             'single-gene disorders. Indeed, the burden of these diseases for '
             'many individuals and their families is substantial. '
             'Nevertheless, the report relates that there is value in human '
             'fragility that would be lost if disabilities were made to '
             'disappear. The experience of fragility is important, giving rise '
             'to the values of care, compassion, and generosity. Moral '
             'philosopher Mike Parker argued that to flourish as a human '
             'involves aspects of both strength and weakness. To paraphrase '
             'Parker: the concept of the best possible life is not necessarily '
             "one in which all goes well.In a similar vein to Isaac Asimov's "
             'Three Laws of Robotics, the authors draw up two principles that '
             'should lead on considerations of heritable genome editing. The '
             'first is that such interventions are intended to secure, and are '
             'consistent with, the welfare of a person who may be born as a '
             'consequence. The second is that such interventions would uphold '
             'principles of social justice and solidarity—meaning not '
             'producing or exacerbating social division, or marginalising or '
             'disadvantaging groups in society.The report—acknowledging Brexit '
             'might have reduced the strength of any potential '
             'collaboration—concludes that a worldwide treaty or convention is '
             'needed. Governments in the UK and elsewhere should combine '
             'forces with international human rights institutions, such as the '
             'Council of Europe and UNESCO, to promote international dialogue '
             'and governance over genome editing, research, and innovation. '
             'The report recommends genome editing should only be licensed for '
             'clinical use once risks of adverse outcomes have been assessed '
             'by competent national and international authorities and that '
             'licences should be issued initially on a case-by-case basis. '
             'Given the current state of the world, where national solipsism '
             'is on the rise and scientific developments can sometimes take '
             'place unchecked, there is no time to waste: the recommendations '

{'abstract': '![Figure][1]  Kelvin Droegemeier has served as The University of '
             "Oklahoma's vice president for research since 2009.  PHOTO: AP "
             'PHOTO/SUE OGROCKI  The long wait for a White House science '
             'adviser is over. This week, President Donald Trump announced he '
             'intends to nominate meteorologist Kelvin Droegemeier, a '
             'university administrator and former vice-chair of the governing '
             'board of the National Science Foundation (NSF), to be director '
             'of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy '
             '(OSTP). The OSTP director traditionally, but not always, holds '
             "the title of the president's science adviser.  The move caps a "
             'search process of record-setting length—nearly 560 days, double '
             'the time taken by other modern presidents to name an OSTP '
             'director. Many researchers had lamented the delay. But the wait '
             'may have been worth it: Droegemeier, 59, is a respected veteran '
             'of the Washington, D.C., policymaking scene and is getting '
             "positive reviews from science and university groups.  “He's a "
             'very good pick. … He has experience speaking science to power,” '
             'says environmental policy expert John Holdren, who served as '
             'science adviser under former President Barack Obama and is now '
             "at Harvard University. “I expect he'll be energetic in defending "
             'the R&D budget and climate change research in particular.”  '
             'Maria Zuber, a planetary geophysicist and vice president for '
             'research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in '
             'Cambridge, agrees that Droegemeier will stand up for climate '
             "science. “He always has. I see no reason why he wouldn't now.” "
             "But she says his style is not confrontational. “He's a good old "
             "boy. He wears cowboy boots. … He's a personable guy.” She adds "
             "that “he's got solid conservative credentials,” noting that his "
             'web page is emblazoned with “God Bless America!!!”  Droegemeier, '
             'who has served on the faculty of The University of Oklahoma in '
             "Norman for 33 years and been the school's vice president for "
             'research since 2009, has long been rumored to be in the running '
             'for the OSTP job, which entails advising the president on '
             'technical issues and overseeing coordination of federal science '
             'policy. He is no stranger to Washington, D.C.; then-President '
             'George W. Bush named him to the National Science Board, which '
             'oversees NSF, in 2004, and Obama reappointed him in 2011. He has '
             'also served as a formal and informal adviser to federal and '
             'state politicians. Recently, he helped craft federal legislation '
             'aimed at bolstering weather forecasting that Congress passed '
             'last year with bipartisan support, and he advised former '
             'Oklahoma Representative Jim Bridenstine (R), now the '
             'administrator of NASA. Those connections likely helped bring '
             "Droegemeier's name to Trump's attention.  As a researcher, "
             'Droegemeier focused on numerical weather forecasting, including '
             'thunderstorm dynamics. He helped found and lead two NSF-funded '
             'centers focused on storm prediction and atmospheric monitoring. '
             '“His command of both science and policy issues is nearly '
             'unmatched in the community,” says Roger Wakimoto, vice '
             'chancellor for research at the University of California, Los '
             'Angeles, and president of the American Meteorological Society in '
             'Boston.  If confirmed by the Senate, Droegemeier will take the '
             'helm of an office that has been buffeted by change. Under Obama, '
             "OSTP's staff grew to some 135 people, and it was active in "
             'shaping budget and policy plans, particularly in the climate '
             "change arena. Under Trump, OSTP's staff plummeted to about 35 "
             'last year, but has since grown to about 60 under the leadership '
             'of its de facto head, OSTP Deputy Chief Technology Officer '
             'Michael Kratsios.  Holdren says Droegemeier has “a big challenge '
             "ahead of him. … I look forward to seeing what he's able to "
             'accomplish in a very challenging circumstance.” Trump has a '
             'reputation for ignoring expert advice. But “it could well be '
             "that [Droegemeier is] thinking: ‘Here's a chance to make a small "
             'difference and to at least be a small voice of reason,’” says '
             'Rick Anthes, president emeritus of the University Corporation '
             'for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.  One of '
             "Droegemeier's first tasks, Holdren says, will be to develop "
             'strong working relationships the other senior White House staff, '
             'including the head of the Office of Management and Budget, which '
             'oversees the annual budget request to Congress. Holdren believes '
             "Trump's budget requests, which have called for large cuts in "
             'some science agencies, “reflect that weakness of not having a '
             'senior scientist engaged as an equal in that process.” Another '
             'task, Holdren says, will be “rebuilding the science part” of '
             'OSTP, which has emphasized technology and workforce issues under '
             'Trump.  Mostly, researchers are relieved that science will '
             'finally have some voice in the White House. “I wish it had '
             'happened a lot earlier,” Holdren says. “But on the other hand, '
             "many of us weren't sure it would ever happen.”   [1]: "

             'to 38 weeks 6 days of gestation to labor induction at 39 weeks 0 '
             'days to 39 weeks 4 days or to expectant management. The primary '
             'outcome was a composite of perinatal death or severe neonatal '

             'We performed tissue receptor profiling and showed that the human '

             'adequate organ function. 5-Azacitidine (V, 75 mg/m2) was given '

             'Aspirin-mediated reductions in long-term risk of colorectal '

             'all-cause death was increased in people weighing less than 50 kg '

             'the 3-year risk of cancer was also increased by aspirin (1·20 '

             "Einstein's explanation of gravity in a unique test, astronomers "
             'have tracked a single star whipping around the supermassive '
             'black hole at the center of our galaxy at 3% of the speed of '
             "light. At the star's closest approach to the black hole, its "
             'light was stretched by the intense gravity in a relativistic '
             "effect called gravitational redshift. Made with Europe's Very "
             'Large Telescope in Chile, the observations conflict with '
             "Newtonian laws but are in precise synchrony with Einstein's "
             'general relativity, the researchers reported last week in the '
             'July issue of Astronomy & Astrophysics. The star, named S2, has '
             'a highly elliptical orbit that takes it within 20 billion '
             'kilometers, or 17 light-hours, of the black hole—closer than any '
             'other known star. During its last close approach, in 2002, '
             'telescopes were not precise enough to make the necessary '
             'measurements. The research team at the Max Planck Institute for '
             'Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, hopes to make '
             'further confirmations of relativity in coming years as the star '
             'moves farther from the black hole and their instruments '

             'spaceflight and the military.  ### Drug development  '
             "![Figure][1]  A woman with Alzheimer's disease looks at an old "
             'photo.  PHOTO: SEBASTIEN BOZON/AFP/GETTY IMAGES  After a string '
             'of recent clinical trial disappointments for potential '
             "Alzheimer's disease treatments, an experimental drug called "
             'BAN2401 drew attention last week for promising, but preliminary, '
             "results presented at the Alzheimer's Association International "
             'Conference in Chicago, Illinois. The therapy, developed by '
             'Biogen Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Eisai Co. Ltd. in '
             'Tokyo, is an antibody that binds to and helps clear out a '
             'protein fragment called β-amyloid, which builds up in the brain '
             "and is thought to drive the disease's neurodegeneration. The "
             'statistically complex phase II trial in 856 people with an early '
             "form of Alzheimer's failed to show benefit after 12 months by "
             "the measure the drug's sponsors selected as the trial's primary "
             'endpoint. But after 18 months, the 161 patients getting the '
             'highest of five doses had reduced brain amyloid buildup, and '
             'their cognitive skills declined 30% more slowly than those of '
             'patients getting a placebo, Eisai announced. But only that small '
             'group showed a statistically significant benefit, and '
             'researchers decided midstudy to remove people with an '
             "Alzheimer's-promoting gene variant from that group—leading many "
             'in the field to await a larger trial to confirm any '
             'disease-slowing effects.  ### Research funding  Projected cost '
             'increases in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could delay '
             "NASA's next large space-based observatory, the Wide Field "
             'Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), NASA Administrator Jim '
             'Bridenstine suggested in testimony to Congress on 25 July. '
             'Following an independent review, NASA announced in June that the '
             'JWST launch would be delayed from May 2020 to March 2021, '
             'leading to $800 million in extra costs over the $8 billion cap '
             'set by Congress in 2011. In congressional hearings to debate the '
             'extra spending, Bridenstine suggested some of the needed funds '
             'could come from delaying WFIRST, scheduled to launch in 2025. '
             'WFIRST, targeting dark energy and exoplanets, is a priority for '
             'astronomers but has less support among politicians: President '
             "Donald Trump's administration wants to kill it, and a House of "
             'Representatives proposal would reduce its budget in 2019. Only '
             'the Senate has offered enough 2019 funding to keep it on '
             'schedule.  ### Science agencies  A noisy debate about alleged '
             'conflicts of interest has led Yves Lévy, the chief executive of '
             "France's key biomedical research agency, to abandon his quest "
             'for a second 4-year term. Lévy, 60, took the helm of the €900 '
             'million INSERM in Paris in 2014; he has pushed research in '
             'genomic medicine, emerging diseases, and antimicrobial '
             'resistance while recruiting more young scientists. But in 2017, '
             "President Emmanuel Macron appointed Lévy's wife, Agnès Buzyn, to "
             'be health minister, a position in which she would share '
             'oversight of INSERM with the research minister. A government '
             'decree temporarily transferred INSERM-related matters to the '
             "prime minister's office, but that didn't satisfy critics of the "
             "power couple, especially after Lévy's term ended last month and "
             'he announced his candidacy for a second one. He reversed course '
             'in a letter to INSERM staff on 30 July. Seven other candidates '
             'remain; Lévy will continue to serve as interim leader until a '
             'successor has been chosen.  ### Biomedicine  An ambitious '
             'project that set out nearly 5 years ago to replicate 50 '
             'high-impact cancer biology papers now expects to complete '
             'experiments from just 18 of them, leaders said last week. The '
             'Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RP:CB) began in October '
             '2013, but because of rising costs and other problems, managers '
             'at the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Virginia, '
             'whittled the list of papers to 29 by January 2017. In the past '
             'few months, they decided to abort 11 ongoing replications. The '
             'RP:CB team has already published its findings about 10 studies, '
             'and the bottom line was mixed: Five were mostly repeatable, '
             "three were inconclusive, and two studies couldn't be replicated, "
             'although the original findings have been confirmed by other '
             'labs. Since the RP:CB project began, many of the original 50 '
             'papers have been confirmed by other groups.  ### Publishing  '
             'U.K.-based publisher Taylor & Francis says it will close a '
             'public health journal whose entire editorial board resigned in '
             'protest last November over various management decisions. The '
             'International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health ( '
             'IJOEH ), which published independent safety studies on chemicals '
             'found in consumer products, had named a new editor-in-chief, '
             'whom its members viewed as too close to industry. In a statement '
             'first reported 27 July by the blog Retraction Watch, Taylor & '
             'Francis said the editor, Andrew Maier, had stepped down because '
             'of “increased commitments elsewhere.” The company concluded it '
             "could not carry out IJOEH 's development plans but will continue "
             'to publish other public health journals. IJOEH will shut down by '
             'December, although some former members of its editorial plan are '
             'looking for a way to keep it going.  ### Drug development  An '
             'antibody that helped “cure” monkeys of infection by simian '
             'immunodeficiency virus (SIV) failed to live up to its promise in '
             'a human study of 18 HIV-infected people, researchers reported '
             'last week at the International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. The '
             'monoclonal antibody blocks a receptor, called α4β7, that is '
             'found on immune cells and makes them more susceptible to HIV '
             'infection. Two years ago, researchers wrote in Science that '
             'after they gave the antibody to monkeys who were receiving '
             'antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to control their SIV infections, the '
             'animals no longer needed the drugs to keep the virus in check ( '
             'Science , 14 October 2016, p. [157][2]). But in HIV-infected '
             'humans, the antibody —which is on the market to treat Crohn '
             'disease and ulcerative colitis—had no such power: When they '
             'stopped taking ARVs, the virus in almost each case quickly came '
             'roaring back.  ### Computer Science  Researchers have developed '
             'a new artificial intelligence (AI) program that can read lips '
             'with a word error rate of 41%, a large improvement over the '
             'previous state of the art technology that had an error rate of '
             '77%. (Professional lip readers in the same study had an error '
             'rate of 93%. The researchers used a form of AI called machine '
             'learning in which computers learn from data, in this case nearly '
             '4000 hours of videos of people talking and transcripts of what '
             'they said. DeepMind, a company in London, published the findings '
             'last month on the website arXiv. Similar software might one day '
             'be installed on a phone, allowing the hard of hearing to '
             '“translate” spoken words into text.   [1]: pending:yes  [2]: '

{'abstract': 'Objectives Recent studies indicate that glucose metabolism is '
             'altered in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like '
             'synoviocytes (FLS). Hexokinases (HKs) catalyse the first step in '
             'glucose metabolism, and HK2 constitutes the principal HK '
             'inducible isoform. We hypothesise that HK2 contributes to the '
             'synovial lining hypertrophy and plays a critical role in bone '
             'and cartilage damage.  Methods HK1 and HK2 expression were '
             'determined in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) synovial tissue by '
             'immunohistochemistry. RA FLS were transfected with either HK1 or '
             'HK2 siRNA, or infected with either adenovirus (ad)-GFP, ad-HK1 '
             'or ad-HK2. FLS migration and invasion were assessed. To study '
             'the role of HK2 in vivo, 108 particles of ad-HK2 or ad-GFP were '
             'injected into the knee of wild-type mice. K/BxN serum transfer '
             'arthritis was induced in HK2F/F mice harbouring Col1a1-Cre '
             '(HK2Col1), to delete HK2 in non-haematopoietic cells.  Results '
             'HK2 is particular of RA histopathology (9/9 RA; 1/8 OA) and '
             'colocalises with FLS markers. Silencing HK2 in RA FLS resulted '
             'in a less invasive and migratory phenotype. Consistently, '
             'overexpression of HK2 resulted in an increased ability to '
             'migrate and invade. It also increased extracellular lactate '
             'production. Intra-articular injection of ad-HK2 in normal knees '
             'dramatically increased synovial lining thickness, FLS activation '
             'and proliferation. HK2 was highly expressed in the synovial '
             'lining after K/BxN serum transfer arthritis. HK2Col1 mice '
             'significantly showed decreased arthritis severity, bone and '
             'cartilage damage.  Conclusion HK2 is specifically expressed in '
             'RA synovial lining and regulates FLS aggressive functions. HK2 '
             'might be an attractive selective metabolic target safer than '
             'global glycolysis for RA treatment.',

             'FastGene Plate Centrifuge is the most efficient, silent, and '
             'easy-to-use centrifuge for spinning down liquids in 96- and '
             '384-well plates. Thanks to its compact size and light weight, it '
             'fits easily on a crowded lab bench. Centrifuging 96- and '
             '384-well plates can be tricky if your lab is performing '
             'high-throughput assays for applications such as PCR, '
             'quantitative PCR, ELISA, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). '
             'Droplets or condensation on the sides of the wells can cause '

             'reaction components from the reaction mixture, and liquid forced '
             'out of wells during centrifugation and into other wells will '
             'result in immediate contamination. FastGene uses an angle that '
             'allows finicky NGS applications to gain access to the bottom of '
             'the wells without disturbing the pellet. Its unique spinning '
             'parameters also keep the liquid in each well far away from the '
             'seal, with no way to contaminate other wells.  The Technology '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: To determine whether a reduction in the intensity of '
             'Total Therapy (TT) reduces toxicity and maintains efficacy.  '
             'Experimental Design: A total of 289 patients with gene '
             'expression profiling (GEP70)-defined low-risk multiple myeloma '
             'were randomized between a standard arm (TT4-S) and a light arm '
             '(TT4-L). TT4-L employed one instead of two inductions and '
             'consolidations. To compensate for potential loss of efficacy of '
             'TT4-L, bortezomib and thalidomide were added to fractionated '
             'melphalan 50 mg/m2/d for 4 days.  Results: Grade ≥3 toxicities '
             'and treatment-related mortalities were not reduced in TT4-L. '
             'Complete response (CR) rates were virtually identical ( P = 0.2; '
             'TT4-S, 59%; TT4-L, 61% at 2 years), although CR duration was '
             'superior with TT4-S ( P = 0.05; TT4-S, 87%; TT4-L, 81% at 2 '
             'years). With a median follow-up of 4.5 years, there was no '
             'difference in overall survival (OS) and progression-free '
             'survival (PFS). Whereas metaphase cytogenetic abnormalities '
             '(CAs) tended to be an adverse feature in TT4-S, as with '
             'predecessor TT trials, the reverse applied to TT4-L. Employing '
             'historical TT3a as training and TT3b as test set, 51 gene probes '
             '(GEP51) significantly differentiated the presence and absence of '
             'CA (q < 0.0001), seven of which function in DNA replication, '
             'recombination, and repair. Applying the GEP51 model to clinical '
             'outcomes, OS and PFS were significantly inferior with GEP51/CA '
             'in TT4-S; such a difference was not observed in TT4-L.  '
             'Conclusions: We identified a prognostic CA-linked GEP51 '

{'abstract': 'While molecular approaches altering mitochondrial content have '

             'bioenergetics and insulin sensitivity, paradoxically, '
             'consumption of a high fat (HF) diet increases mitochondrial '
             'content while inducing insulin-resistance. We hypothesized that '
             'despite the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, consumption '
             'of a HF diet would impair mitochondrial ADP sensitivity in '
             'skeletal muscle of mice, and therefore manifest in mitochondrial '
             'dysfunction in the presence of ADP concentrations indicative of '
             'skeletal muscle biology. We found that HF consumption increased '
             'mitochondrial protein expression, however absolute mitochondrial '
             'respiration and ADP sensitivity were impaired across a range of '
             'biologically relevant ADP concentrations. In addition, HF '
             'consumption attenuated the ability of ADP to suppress '
             'mitochondrial H2O2 emission, further suggesting impairments in '
             'ADP sensitivity. The abundance of ADP transport proteins were '
             'not altered, while the sensitivity to '
             'carboxyatractyloside-mediated inhibition was attenuated '
             'following HF consumption, implicating alterations in adenine '
             'nucleotide translocase (ANT) ADP sensitivity in these '
             'observations. Moreover, palmitoyl-CoA is known to inhibit ANT, '

             'occur following HF consumption exacerbated the deficiency in ADP '

{'abstract': 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a complex and heterogeneous '

             'experience in lupus management and methodologists) had an '
             'initial meeting in Panama City, Panama, in April 2016. They '

             'pulmonary, neuropsychiatric, haematological manifestations and '

             'around to it will have more comfortable retirements.  Yet, the '
             'same techniques for nudging can be used for less benevolent '
             'purposes. Take the enterprise of marketing goods and services. '
             'Firms may encourage buyers in order to maximize profits rather '
             "than to improve the buyers' welfare (think of financier Bernie "
             'Madoff who defrauded thousands of investors). A common example '
             'is when firms offer a rebate to customers who buy a product, but '
             'then require them to mail in a form, a copy of the receipt, the '
             'SKU bar code on the packaging, and so forth. These companies are '
             'only offering the illusion of a rebate to the many people like '
             'me who never get around to claiming it. Because of such thick '
             'sludge, redemption rates for rebates tend to be low, yet the '
             'lure of the rebate still can stimulate sales—call it “buy '
             'bait.”  Public sector sludge also comes in many forms. For '
             'example, in the United States, there is a program called the '
             'earned income tax credit that is intended to encourage work and '
             'transfer income to the working poor. The Internal Revenue '
             'Service has all the information necessary to make adjustments '
             'for credit claims by any eligible taxpayer who files a tax '
             'return. But instead, the rules require people to fill out a form '
             'that many eligible taxpayers fail to complete, thus depriving '
             'themselves of the subsidy that Congress intended they receive.  '
             'Similarly, one of the most important rights of citizens is the '
             'ability to vote. Increased voter participation can be nudged by '
             "automatically registering anyone who applies for a driver's "
             'license. But voter participation can also be decreased through '
             'sludge, as the state of Ohio has recently done, by purging from '
             'its list of eligible voters those who have not voted recently '
             'and who have not responded to a postcard prompt. Defenders of '
             'such sludge claim that it serves as a protection against voter '
             'fraud, despite the fact that people who intentionally vote '
             'illegally are rare.  So, sludge can take two forms. It can '
             "discourage behavior that is in a person's best interest such as "
             'claiming a rebate or tax credit, and it can encourage '
             'self-defeating behavior such as investing in a deal that is too '
             "good to be true.  Let's continue to encourage everyone to nudge "
             "for good, but let's also urge those in both the public and "
             'private sectors to engage in sludge cleanup campaigns. Less '
             'sludge will make the world a better place.   [1]: pending:yes',

{'abstract': 'Before insulin can stimulate muscle glucose uptake, it must be '
             'delivered to skeletal muscle (SkM) through the microvasculature. '
             'Insulin delivery is determined by SkM perfusion and the rate of '
             'insulin movement across the capillary endothelium. The '
             'endothelium, therefore, plays a central role in regulating '
             'insulin access to SkM. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key regulator of '
             'endothelial function. NO stimulates arterial vasodilation which '
             'increases SkM perfusion and the capillary surface area for '
             'insulin exchange. The effects of NO on trans-endothelial insulin '
             'efflux (TIE), however, are unknown. We hypothesized that acute '
             'reduction of endothelial NO would reduce TIE. However, '
             'intravital imaging of TIE in mice revealed that reduction of NO '
             'with L-NG-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) enhanced the rate '
             'of TIE by ∼30% and increased total extravascular insulin '
             'delivery. This accelerated TIE was associated with more rapid '
             'insulin-stimulated glucose lowering. Treating mice with sodium '
             'nitroprusside, an NO donor, had no effect on TIE. The effects of '
             'L-NAME on TIE were not due to changes in blood pressure alone, '
             'as a direct-acting vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine) did not '
             'affect TIE. These results demonstrate that acute NO synthase '
             'inhibition increases capillary permeability to insulin, leading '

{'abstract': 'The recent demonstration of modest single-agent activity of '
             'programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death '
             'receptor-1 (PD-1) antibodies in patients with breast cancer has '
             'generated hope that breast cancer can be made amenable to '
             'immunotherapy. Depending on the subtype of breast cancer, it is '
             'now clear in both primary and metastatic disease that the extent '
             'of tumor-infiltrating T cells is not only prognostic for '
             'survival but predictive of response to nonimmune, standard '
             'therapies. Despite these findings, immune cytolytic activity in '
             'spontaneous breast tumors, the burden of nonsynonymous tumor '
             'mutations, and the predicted load of neoepitopes—factors linked '
             'to response to checkpoint blockade in other malignancies—are all '
             'relatively modest in breast cancer compared with melanoma or '
             'lung cancer. Thus, in breast cancer, combinations of immune '
             'agents with nonredundant mechanisms of action are high-priority '
             'strategies. For most breast cancers that exhibit relatively '
             'modest T-cell infiltration, major challenges include immune '
             'suppression in the tumor microenvironment as well as failed or '
             'suboptimal T-cell priming. Agents that trigger de novo T-cell '
             'responses may be critical for the successful development of '
             'cancer immunotherapy and immune prevention in breast cancer. '
             'Success may also require reaching beyond nonsynonymous mutations '
             'as the T-cell epitopes to target, especially as numerous '
             'unmutated proteins were validated as breast cancer–associated '
             'antigens in the pre-checkpoint era. A deeper understanding of '
             'the immunobiology of breast cancer will be critical for '

{'abstract': 'Ammonia detoxification and gluconeogenesis are major hepatic '

{'abstract': 'Background Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is frequently used to '
             'treat rheumatoid arthritis due to potent anti-inflammatory '
             'actions of GCs. Direct actions of GCs on immune cells were '
             'suggested to suppress inflammation.  Objectives Define the role '
             'of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in stromal cells for '
             'suppression of inflammatory arthritis.  Methods Bone marrow '
             'chimeric mice lacking the GR in the hematopoietic or stromal '
             'compartment, respectively, and mice with impaired GR '
             'dimerisation (GRdim) were analysed for their response to '
             'dexamethasone (DEX, 1\u2009mg/kg) treatment in serum '
             'transfer-induced arthritis (STIA). Joint swelling, cell '
             'infiltration (histology), cytokines, cell composition (flow '
             'cytometry) and gene expression were analysed and RNASeq of wild '
             'type and GRdim primary murine fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) '
             'was performed.  Results GR deficiency in immune cells did not '
             'impair GC-mediated suppression of STIA. In contrast, mice with '
             'GR-deficient or GR dimerisation-impaired stromal cells were '
             'resistant to GC treatment, despite efficient suppression of '
             'cytokines. Intriguingly, in mice with impaired GR function in '
             'the stromal compartment, GCs failed to stimulate non-classical, '
             'non-activated macrophages (Ly6Cneg, MHCIIneg) and associated '
             'anti-inflammatory markers CD163, CD36, AnxA1, MerTK and Axl. '
             'Mice with GR deficiency in FLS were partially resistant to '
             'GC-induced suppression of STIA. Accordingly, RNASeq analysis of '
             'DEX-treated GRdim FLS revealed a distinct gene signature '
             'indicating enhanced activity and a failure to reduce macrophage '
             'inflammatory protein (Mip)-1α and Mip-1β.  Conclusion We report '
             'a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of GC action that involves '
             'GR dimerisation-dependent gene regulation in non-immune stromal '

{'abstract': 'Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) represent the '
             'most common cystic preinvasive lesion in the pancreas, which can '
             'progress to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). '
             'Patients with radiological findings consistent with IPMN are '
             'strictly monitored with imaging techniques, and surgical '
             'resection is recommended in case of clinical and/or radiological '
             '‘high-risk stigmata’ or ‘worrisome features’.1 2 Recent research '
             'has suggested the potential role of molecular analysis of cyst '
             'fluid to discriminate IPMNs from other types of pancreatic cysts '
             'and from invasive lesions.3–6   Notably, recent evidences '
             'pointed out the presence of a so-called ‘fieldeffect’ of '
             'pancreatic carcinogenesis. This concept indicates the occurrence '
             'of seemingly unrelated patches of non-neoplastic cells that may '
             'be partly shared with a tumour lesion.7 Therefore, within the '
             'pancreas not only a preinvasive lesion is at risk of progression '
             'to malignancy but independent preinvasive and invasive lesions '
             'may develop as well. In other words, the ‘fieldeffect’ might '
             'separately predispose to both preinvasive and invasive lesions. '
             'Along this line, Pea and colleagues, sequenced DNA from a cohort '
             'of IPMNs and PDAC from the same patients, showing that a '
             'significant proportion of the recurrent cancers was likely '

             'suggested by the work of Shindo and colleagues, who reported '

             'sudden cardiac deaths, which were confirmed with autopsy '

             'to have cardiac disorders that are associated with sudden '
             'cardiac death. A further 225 athletes (2%) with congenital or '
             'valvular abnormalities were identified. After screening, there '
             'were 23 deaths from any cause, of which 8 (35%) were sudden '
             'deaths attributed to cardiac disease. Cardiomyopathy accounted '
             'for 7 of 8 sudden cardiac deaths (88%). Six athletes (75%) with '
             'sudden cardiac death had had normal cardiac screening results. '
             'The mean time between screening and sudden cardiac death was 6.8 '

             'wound-healing consultation, which are examples of costly '
             'contributors to postoperative health-care spending.Methods:The '
             'medical records for 1,024 patients undergoing TAAs between June '
             '2007 and December 2016 at a single academic center in the '

             'consultation within the 90-day post-discharge period. All '
             'patients undergoing TAA (n = 1,365) were eligible. Of the 1,037 '
             'patients who consented to participation in the study and '
             'underwent TAA, 1,024 (98.7%) completed the study. Medical '
             'comorbidities according to the Elixhauser and Charlson-Deyo '
             'comorbidity indices that were present prior to TAA were '
             'recorded. Univariate and multivariable tests of significance '
             'were used to relate patient and operative characteristics to '
             'outcomes.Results:Four hundred and ninety-six (48.4%) of the '
             '1,024 patients were female, and 964 (94.1%) were '
             'white/Caucasian, with an average age (and standard deviation) of '
             '63 ± 10.5 years. Hypertension, obesity, solid tumor, depression, '
             'rheumatic disease, cardiac arrhythmia, hypothyroidism, diabetes '
             'mellitus, and chronic pulmonary disease had a prevalence of '
             '&gt;10%. Fifty-three (5.2%) of the 1,024 patients were '
             'readmitted for any cause. Thirty-six (3.5%) of the 1,024 '

             'Readmission or ED visitation was most commonly for a wound '

             'pulmonary embolism (PE) evaluation, while urgent medical '
             'evaluations composed the majority of non-TAA-related ED '

             'Readmissions were dominated by evaluation of wound compromise as '

             'a follow-up held-out data evaluation, and an online platform, '
             'Epilepsyecosystem.org, for yielding further improvements in '

             'via the ‘Melbourne-University AES-MathWorks-NIH Seizure '
             'Prediction Challenge’ conducted at kaggle.com. Long-term '
             'continuous intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data (442 '
             'days of recordings and 211 lead seizures per patient) from '

             'algorithms to distinguish between 10-min inter-seizure versus '
             'pre-seizure data clips. Over 10 000 algorithms were submitted. '
             'The top algorithms as determined by using the contest data were '

{'abstract': 'Background:Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an effective '
             'operation for the management of end-stage hip osteoarthritis, '
             'but long-term success can be limited by wear of the polyethylene '

             'polyethylene (CPE) at 16 years after THAs performed for the '

             'observational study of data, from a national registry, on all '
             'patients who underwent THA for osteoarthritis in Australia from '
             '1999 through December 31, 2016. The outcomes of THAs performed '
             'with CPE were compared with those of THAs performed with XLPE, '
             'along with an analysis of the effect of age, sex, femoral head '
             'size, the method of acetabular and femoral component fixation, '
             'and the reasons and types of revision. The principal outcome '
             'measure was the time to the first revision, determined using '
             'Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship.Results:CPE was used in '
             '41,171 procedures, and XLPE was used in 199,131. The mean ages '
             'of the men and women treated with CPE were 70.0 years (standard '
             'deviation [SD] = 9.9 years) and 72.5 years (SD = 9.7 years), '
             'respectively, whereas the men and women who received XLPE were '
             'slightly younger (mean age, 68.6 years [SD = 10.3 years] and '
             '70.7 years [SD = 9.9 years], respectively. XLPE was associated '
             'with a lower rate of revision than CPE at 6 months, and this '
             'difference became more apparent with time. The 16-year '
             'cumulative percentage of revisions of the primary THAs was 11.7% '
             '(95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.1% to 12.3%]) in the CPE '

             'revision at 16 years following THA for osteoarthritis. This '
             'evidence suggests that the longevity of THA is likely to be '

{'abstract': 'Objective Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), a probiotic, given '

             'interposition (LRTI) leads to improved patient-reported outcomes '
             'compared with an early mobilization protocol.Methods:At 2 '
             'institutions, we prospectively randomized 223 patients (238 '
             'thumbs) undergoing LRTI to receive 1 of 2 postoperative '
             'rehabilitation protocols. The immobilization protocol consisted '
             'of use of a postoperative forearm-based thumb-spica splint for 7 '
             'days followed by a forearm-based thumb-spica cast for 5 weeks '
             'and then by a custom forearm-based thermoplastic thumb-spica '
             'splint for an additional 6 weeks. An active range of motion '
             '(ROM) was started 6 weeks postoperatively. The early '
             'mobilization protocol consisted of the same postoperative splint '
             'for 7 days followed by use of a forearm-based thermoplastic '
             'thumb-spica splint for 3 weeks and then by a hand-based '
             'thumb-spica splint for 4 weeks. An active ROM was started 4 '
             'weeks postoperatively. The outcome measures included the '
             'Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire; '
             'pinch and grip strength; 9-hole peg test (NHP); visual analog '
             'scale (VAS) for pain; VAS for patient satisfaction; and wrist '
             'and thumb ROM. These were measured preoperatively and at 6, 12, '
             '26, 52, and 104 weeks postoperatively. Differences in continuous '
             'and categorical variables were assessed with use of Tukey '
             'multiple comparisons following 1-way analysis of variance and '
             'Fisher exact tests, respectively.Results:A minimum follow-up of '
             '1 year (mean, 1.7 years) was achieved for 71% (169) of the 238 '

             'the immune landscape of HBV-related HCC and its influence on the '
             'design of effective cancer immunotherapeutics.  Methods We '
             'interrogated the immune microenvironments of HBV-related HCC and '
             'non-viral-related HCC using immunohistochemistry and cytometry '
             'by time-of-flight (CyTOF). On identifying unique immune subsets '
             'enriched in HBV-related HCC, we further interrogated their '
             'phenotypes and functions using next-generation sequencing (NGS) '
             'and in vitro T-cell proliferation assays.  Results In-depth '
             'interrogation of the immune landscapes showed that regulatory T '
             'cells (TREG) and CD8+ resident memory T cells (TRM) were '

             'CD244+ natural killer cells were enriched in non-viral-related '
             'HCC. NGS of isolated TREG and TRM from HBV-related HCC and '
             'non-viral-related HCC identified distinct functional signatures '
             'associated with T-cell receptor signalling, T-cell '
             'costimulation, antigen presentation and programmed cell death '
             'protein 1 (PD-1) signalling. TREG and TRM from HBV-related HCC '
             'expressed more PD-1 and were functionally more suppressive and '
             'exhausted than those from non-virus-related HCC. Furthermore, '
             'immunosuppression by PD-1+ TREG could be reversed with anti-PD-1 '
             'blockade. Using multiplexed tissue immunofluorescence, we '
             'further demonstrated that TREG and TRM contributed to overall '
             'patient survival: TREG were associated with a poor prognosis and '
             'TRM were associated with a good prognosis in HCC.  Conclusion We '

{'abstract': 'Objective To examine the effect on the trade in opioids through '

             'Enforcement Administration’s ruling in 2014 to reschedule '
             'hydrocodone combination products.  Design Interrupted time '
             'series analysis.  Setting 31 of the world’s largest '
             'cryptomarkets operating from October 2013 to July 2016.  Main '
             'outcome measures The proportion of total transactions, '
             'advertised and active listings for prescription opioids, '
             'prescription sedatives, prescription steroids, prescription '
             'stimulants, and illicit opioids, and the composition of the '
             'prescription opioid market between the US and elsewhere.  '
             'Results The sale of prescription opioids through US '
             'cryptomarkets increased after the schedule change, with no '
             'statistically significant changes in sales of prescription '
             'sedatives, prescription steroids, prescription stimulants, or '
             'illicit opioids. In July 2016 sales of opioids through US '
             'cryptomarkets represented 13.7% of all drug sales (95% '
             'confidence interval 11.5% to 16.0%) compared with a modelled '
             'estimate of 6.7% of all sales (3.7% to 9.6%) had the new '
             'schedule not been introduced. This corresponds to a 4 percentage '
             'point yearly increase in the amount of trade that prescription '
             'opioids represent in the US market, set against no corresponding '
             'changes for comparable products or for prescription opioids sold '
             'outside the US. This change was first observed for sales, and '
             'later observed for product availability. There was also a change '
             'in the composition of the prescription opioid market: fentanyl '
             'was the least purchased product during July to September 2014, '
             'then the second most frequently purchased by July 2016.  '
             'Conclusions The scheduling change in hydrocodone combination '
             'products coincided with a statistically significant, sustained '
             'increase in illicit trading of opioids through online US '
             'cryptomarkets. These changes were not observed for other drug '

{'abstract': 'Tumor formation is a multistep process during which cells '
             'acquire genetic and epigenetic changes until they reach a fully '
             'transformed state. We show that CDK6 contributes to tumor '
             'formation by regulating transcriptional responses in a '
             'stage-specific manner. In early stages, the CDK6 kinase induces '
             'a complex transcriptional program to block p53 in hematopoietic '
             'cells. Cells lacking CDK6 kinase function are required to mutate '
             'TP53 (encoding p53) to achieve a fully transformed immortalized '
             'state. CDK6 binds to the promoters of genes including the p53 '

             'to human patients: Tumors with low levels of CDK6 have mutations '

             'unrelated patients with a new subtype of autosomal recessive '
             'cerebellar ataxia caused by biallelic, gene-disruptive mutations '
             'in GDAP2, a gene previously not implicated in disease. Both '
             'patients had onset of ataxia in the fourth decade. Other '
             'features included progressive spasticity and dementia. '
             'Neuropathological examination showed degenerative changes in the '
             'cerebellum, olive inferior, thalamus, substantia nigra, and '
             'pyramidal tracts, as well as tau pathology in the hippocampus '

             'uncoordinated walking behaviour, and compromised flight. Gdap2 '
             'expression levels responded to stress treatments in control '

             'deleterious effects of stressors such as reactive oxygen species '
             'and nutrient deprivation. Thus, Gdap2 knockdown in Drosophila '

{'abstract': 'We report that PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells use '

             'reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that gave a '
             'prevalence of incidental abnormalities (“incidentalomas”). An '
             'incidental imaging finding was defined as an imaging abnormality '
             'in a healthy, asymptomatic patient or an imaging abnormality in '
             'a symptomatic patient, where the abnormality was not apparently '
             'related to the patient’s symptoms. Primary studies that measured '
             'the prevalence of incidentalomas in patients with a history of '
             'malignancy were also considered in sensitivity analyses.  '
             'Results 20 systematic reviews (240 primary studies) were '
             'identified from 7098 references from the database search. '
             'Fifteen systematic reviews provided data to quantify the '
             'prevalence of incidentalomas, whereas 18 provided data to '
             'quantify the outcomes of incidentalomas (13 provided both). The '
             'prevalence of incidentalomas varied substantially between '
             'imaging tests; it was less than 5% for chest computed tomography '
             'for incidental pulmonary embolism in patients with and without '
             'cancer and whole body positron emission tomography (PET) or '
             'PET/computed tomography (for patients with and without cancer). '
             'Conversely, incidentalomas occurred in more than a third of '
             'images in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest '
             'computed tomography (for incidentalomas of thorax, abdomen, '
             'spine, or heart), and computed tomography colonoscopy (for '
             'extra-colonic incidentalomas). Intermediate rates occurred with '
             'MRI of the spine (22%) and brain (22%). The rate of malignancy '
             'in incidentalomas varied substantially between organs; the '
             'prevalence of malignancy was less than 5% in incidentalomas of '
             'the brain, parotid, and adrenal gland. Extra-colonic, prostatic, '
             'and colonic incidentalomas were malignant between 10% and 20% of '
             'the time, whereas renal, thyroid, and ovarian incidentalomas '
             'were malignant around a quarter of the time. Breast '
             'incidentalomas had the highest percentage of malignancy (42%, '
             '95% confidence interval 31% to 54%). Many assessments had high '
             'between-study heterogeneity (15 of 20 meta-analyses with I2 '
             '>50%).  Conclusions There is large variability across different '
             'imaging techniques both in the prevalence of incidentalomas and '

{'abstract': 'Metastases, the spread of cancer cells to distant organs, cause '
             'the majority of cancer-related deaths. Few metastasis-specific '
             'driver mutations have been identified, suggesting aberrant gene '
             'regulation as a source of metastatic traits. However, how '
             'metastatic gene expression programs arise is poorly understood. '
             'Here, using human-derived metastasis models of renal cancer, we '
             'identify transcriptional enhancers that promote metastatic '
             'carcinoma progression. Specific enhancers and enhancer clusters '

{'abstract': 'Lack of interest in social interaction is a hallmark of autism '

             'little is known about the integrity of this pathway and its '
             'behavioural consequences in children with autism spectrum '
             'disorder. Here we test the hypothesis that the structural and '
             'functional integrity of the mesolimbic reward pathway is '
             'aberrant in children with autism spectrum disorder, and these '
             'aberrancies contribute to the social interaction impairments. We '
             'examine structural and functional connectivity of the mesolimbic '
             'reward pathway in two independent cohorts totalling 82 children '
             'aged 7–13 years with autism spectrum disorder and age-, gender-, '
             'and intelligence quotient-matched typically developing children '
             '(primary cohort: children with autism spectrum disorder n = 24, '
             'typically developing children n = 24; replication cohort: '
             'children with autism spectrum disorder n = 17, typically '
             'developing children n = 17), using high angular resolution '
             'diffusion-weighted imaging and functional MRI data. We reliably '
             'identify white matter tracts linking—the nucleus accumbens and '
             'the ventral tegmental area—key subcortical nodes of the '

             'structural aberrations in these tracts in children with autism '

             'with hereditary predisposition to leukemia have been identified. '
             'Although several of these disorders also predispose individuals '
             'to solid tumors, certain conditions exist in which individuals '
             'are specifically at increased risk to develop myelodysplastic '
             'syndrome (MDS) and/or acute leukemia. The increasing '
             'identification of affected individuals and families has raised '
             'questions around the efficacy, timing, and optimal methods of '
             'surveillance. As part of the AACR Childhood Cancer '
             'Predisposition Workshop, an expert panel met to review the '
             'spectrum of leukemia-predisposing conditions, with the aim to '
             'develop consensus recommendations for surveillance for pediatric '
             'patients. The panel recognized that for several conditions, '
             'routine monitoring with complete blood counts and bone marrow '
             'evaluations is essential to identify disease evolution and '
             'enable early intervention with allogeneic hematopoietic stem '
             'cell transplantation. However, for others, less intensive '
             'surveillance may be considered. Because few reports describing '
             'the efficacy of surveillance exist, the recommendations derived '
             'by this panel are based on opinion, and local experience and '
             'will need to be revised over time. The development of registries '
             'and clinical trials is urgently needed to enhance understanding '
             'of the natural history of the leukemia-predisposing conditions, '
             'such that these surveillance recommendations can be optimized to '
             'further enhance long-term outcomes. Clin Cancer Res; 23(11); '

             'evaluated 40 entheses from five patients with SpA/PsA at four '

             'detected lesions was quite low except for enthesophytes (55%) '

{'abstract': 'Objective Although lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) are '
             'increasingly used for drainage of walled-off necrosis (WON), '
             'their advantage over plastic stents is unclear. We compared '
             'efficacy of LAMS and plastic stents for WON drainage.  Design '
             'Patients with WON were randomised to endoscopic '
             'ultrasound-guided drainage using LAMS or plastic stents. Primary '
             'outcome was comparing total number of procedures to achieve '
             'treatment success defined as symptom relief in conjunction with '
             'WON resolution on CT at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were '
             'treatment success, procedure duration, clinical/stent-related '
             'adverse events, readmissions, length of hospital stay (LOS) and '
             'costs.  Results 60 patients underwent LAMS (n=31) or plastic '
             'stent (n=29) placement. There was no significant difference in '
             'total number of procedures performed (median 2 (range 2–7) LAMS '
             'vs 3 (range 2–7) plastic, p=0.192), treatment success, clinical '
             'adverse events, readmissions, LOS and overall treatment costs '
             'between cohorts. Although procedure duration was shorter (15 vs '
             '40 min, p<0.001), stent-related adverse events (32.3% vs 6.9%, '
             'p=0.01) and procedure costs (US$12\u2009155 vs US$6609, p<0.001) '
             'were higher with LAMS. Significant stent-related adverse events '
             'were observed ≥3 weeks postintervention in LAMS cohort. Interim '
             'audit resulted in protocol amendment where CT scan was obtained '
             'at 3\u2009weeks postintervention followed by LAMS removal if WON '
             'had resolved. After protocol amendment, there was no significant '
             'difference in adverse events between cohorts.  Conclusion Except '

             'treatment outcomes between LAMS and plastic stents. To minimise '

{'abstract': 'Emerging evidence supports the importance of ghrelin to defend '
             'against starvation-induced hypoglycemia. This effect may be '
             'mediated by inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion '
             'as well as reduced insulin sensitivity. However, administration '
             'of ghrelin during meal consumption also stimulates the release '
             'of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin important in '
             'nutrient disposition. The objective of this study was to '
             'evaluate the interaction between ghrelin and GLP-1 on parameters '
             'of glucose tolerance following a mixed nutrient meal. Fifteen '
             'healthy men and women completed the study. Each consumed a '
             'standard meal on four separate occasions with a superimposed '
             'infusion of: a) saline, b) ghrelin, c) the GLP-1 receptor '
             'antagonist exendin-\\[9-39\\] (Ex9), or d) combined ghrelin and '
             'Ex9. Similar to previous studies, infusion of ghrelin caused '
             'glucose intolerance, while Ex9 had a minimal effect. However, '
             'combined ghrelin and Ex9 resulted in greater postprandial '
             'glycemia than either alone, and this effect was associated with '
             'impaired β-cell function and decreased glucose clearance. These '
             'findings suggest that in the fed state, stimulation of GLP-1 '
             'mitigates some of the effect of ghrelin on glucose tolerance. '
             'This novel interaction between gastrointestinal hormones '
             'suggests a system that balances insulin secretion and glucose '

             'Prospective observational cohort study.  Setting 10 primary care '

             'consecutive patients aged 18 years or more referred for ABPM in '
             'routine clinical practice. All underwent ABPM and had the '
             'PROOF-BP applied.  Main outcome measures The main outcome was '
             'the proportion of participants whose hypertensive status was '
             'correctly classified using the triaging strategy compared with '
             'the reference standard of daytime ABPM. Secondary outcomes were '
             'the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver '
             'operator characteristic curve (AUROC) for detecting '
             'hypertension.  Results The mean age of participants was 52.8 '
             '(16.2) years. The triaging strategy correctly classified '
             'hypertensive status in 801 of the 887 participants (90%, 95% '
             'confidence interval 88% to 92%) and had a sensitivity of 97% '
             '(95% confidence interval 96% to 98%) and specificity of 76% (95% '
             'confidence interval 71% to 81%) for hypertension. The AUROC was '
             '0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.89). Use of triaging, '
             'rather than uniform referral for ABPM in routine practice, would '
             'have resulted in 435 patients (49%, 46% to 52%) being referred '
             'for ABPM and the remainder managed on the basis of their clinic '
             'measurements. Of these, 69 (8%, 6% to 10%) would have received '
             'treatment deemed unnecessary had they received ABPM.  '
             'Conclusions In a population of patients referred for ABPM, this '
             'new triaging approach accurately classified hypertensive status '
             'for most, with half the utilisation of ABPM compared with usual '

{'abstract': 'Altering the gut microbiome may be beneficial to the host and '

             'metabolic parameter changes in mice. Four groups were compared: '

             'Population approaches change social norms (e.g., smoking bans) '
             'or impose incentives (e.g., cigarette taxes); high-risk '

             'of myocardial injury, and CV involvement using cardiac magnetic '
             'resonance (CMR).  Methods and results This is a two-centre '
             '(London and Frankfurt) CMR imaging study at 3.0 Tesla of '
             'consecutive 92 patients with SLE free of cardiac symptoms, '
             'undergoing screening for cardiac involvement. Venous samples '
             'were drawn and analysed post-hoc for cardiac biomarkers, '
             'including hs-TropT, high-sensitive C reactive protein and '
             'N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide. Compared with '
             'age-matched/gender-matched non-SLE controls (n=78), patients had '
             'significantly raised cardiac biomarker levels, native T1 and T2, '
             'aortic and ventricular stiffness, and reduced global '
             'longitudinal strain (p<0.01). In SLE, hs-TropT was significantly '

             'models including native T1 and aortic stiffness (Χ2 0.462, '

             'and in vivo. Importantly, lapatinib treatment results in growth '
             'arrest and cell death of JAGGED1 low-expressing cells while the '

{'abstract': 'We read the article by Cheung et al 1 with interest. The '
             'research question whether there is a dose-related association '

             'country where this malignancy is highly prevalent is an '
             'important one. They report that long-term PPI therapy is '
             'associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer in patients '
             'who have received Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. The '
             'data suggest that patients taking PPI less than once per day had '

{'abstract': 'Objective We aimed to determine the agreement between '
             'rheumatologist-judged inflammatory back pain (IBP) and criteria '
             'defining IBP in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and '
             'predictive value of IBP in identifying axial involvement in '
             'PsA.  Methods Using prospectively collected data, we '
             'investigated the agreement between rheumatologist judgement of '
             'IBP and IBP criteria (Calin, Rudwaleit and Assessment of '
             'Spondyloarthritis International Society) using the kappa '
             'coefficient. We also determined the sensitivity, specificity and '
             'likelihood ratios of the presence of back pain, '
             'rheumatologist-judged IBP and the three IBP criteria for '
             'detecting axial PsA (AxPsA). Finally, we compared the clinical '
             'and genetic markers in patients with PsA with axial radiological '
             'changes with and without back pain.  Results 171 patients (52% '
             'male, mean age 46.6 years) were identified. Ninety-six (56.13%) '
             'patients reported chronic back pain. Sixty-five (38.01%) had '
             'IBP. 54 (32%) patients had evidence of radiological change in '
             'the spine. The agreement between rheumatologist judgement of IBP '
             'and IBP criteria was highest for the Calin criteria (0.70). '
             'Positive likelihood ratio for the presence of radiological axial '
             'involvement was highest for Rudwaleit criteria (2.17). No '

             'fat mass and lean body mass showed a strong positive monotonic '
             'association between predicted fat mass and all cause mortality. '
             'Compared with those in the lowest fifth of predicted fat mass, '
             'men in the highest fifth had a hazard ratio of 1.35 (95% '
             'confidence interval 1.26 to 1.46) for mortality from all causes. '
             'In contrast, a U shaped association was found between predicted '
             'lean body mass and all cause mortality. Compared with those in '
             'the lowest fifth of predicted lean body mass, men in the second '
             'to fourth fifths had 8-10% lower risk of mortality from all '
             'causes. In the restricted cubic spline models, the risk of all '
             'cause mortality was relatively flat until 21 kg of predicted fat '
             'mass and increased rapidly afterwards, with a hazard ratio of '
             '1.22 (1.18 to 1.26) per standard deviation. For predicted lean '
             'body mass, a large reduction of the risk was seen within the '
             'lower range until 56 kg, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 (0.82 to '
             '0.92) per standard deviation, which increased thereafter (P for '
             'non-linearity <0.001). For cause specific mortality, men in the '
             'highest fifth of predicted fat mass had hazard ratios of 1.67 '
             '(1.47 to 1.89) for cardiovascular disease, 1.24 (1.09 to 1.43) '
             'for cancer, and 1.26 (0.97 to 1.64) for respiratory disease. On '
             'the other hand, a U shaped association was found between '
             'predicted lean body mass and mortality from cardiovascular '
             'disease and cancer. However, a strong inverse association '
             'existed between predicted lean body mass and mortality from '
             'respiratory disease (P for trend <0.001).  Conclusions The shape '
             'of the association between BMI and mortality was determined by '
             'the relation between two body components (lean body mass and fat '
             'mass) and mortality. This finding suggests that the “obesity '
             'paradox” controversy may be largely explained by low lean body '

             'and healthy controls (n = 126) enrolled in the Alzheimer’s '

             'provided by the Allen brain atlas of the adult human brain '
             'transcriptome. In a hypothesis-driven analysis focusing on the '
             'genes coding for the amyloid precursor (APP) and tau proteins '
             '(MAPT), regional expression levels of APP were positively '
             'correlated with the severity of regional amyloid deposition (r = '
             '0.44, P = 0.009), but not neurodegeneration (r = 0.01, P = '

             '(neurodegeneration: r = 0.46, P = 0.006; amyloid: r = 0.08, P = '
             '0.65). Using explorative gene set enrichment analysis, '
             'amyloid-vulnerable regions were found to be characterized by '
             'relatively low expression levels of gene sets implicated in '
             'protein synthesis and mitochondrial respiration. By contrast, '
             'neurodegeneration-vulnerable regions were characterized by '
             'relatively high expression levels of gene sets broadly '
             'implicated in neural plasticity, with biological functions '
             'ranging from neurite outgrowth and synaptic contact over '
             'intracellular signalling cascades to proteoglycan metabolism. At '
             'the individual gene level this data-driven analysis further '
             'corroborated the association between neurodegeneration and MAPT '

             'tau kinases (CDK5, MAPK1/ERK2) alongside components of their '
             'intracellular (Ras-ERK) activation pathways. Sensitivity '
             'analyses showed that these pathology-specific imaging-genetic '
             'associations were largely robust against changes in some of the '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using tumor-infiltrating '
             'lymphocytes (TIL) has consistently demonstrated clinical '
             'efficacy in metastatic melanoma. Recent widespread use of '
             'checkpoint blockade has shifted the treatment landscape, raising '
             'questions regarding impact of these therapies on response to TIL '
             'and appropriate immunotherapy sequence.  Experimental Design: '
             'Seventy-four metastatic melanoma patients were treated with '
             'autologous TIL and evaluated for clinical response according to '
             'irRC, overall survival, and progression-free survival. '
             'Immunologic factors associated with response were also '
             'evaluated.  Results: Best overall response for the entire cohort '
             'was 42%; 47% in 43 checkpoint-naïve patients, 38% when patients '
             'were exposed to anti-CTLA4 alone (21 patients) and 33% if also '
             'exposed to anti-PD1 (9 patients) prior to TIL ACT. Median '
             'overall survival was 17.3 months; 24.6 months in CTLA4-naïve '
             'patients and 8.6 months in patients with prior CTLA4 blockade. '
             'The latter patients were infused with fewer TIL and experienced '
             'a shorter duration of response. Infusion of higher numbers of '
             'TIL with CD8 predominance and expression of BTLA correlated with '
             'improved response in anti-CTLA4 naïve patients, but not in '
             'anti-CTLA4 refractory patients. Baseline serum levels of IL9 '
             'predicted response to TIL ACT, while TIL persistence, tumor '
             'recognition, and mutation burden did not correlate with '
             'outcome.  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the deleterious '
             'effects of prior exposure to anti-CTLA4 on TIL ACT response and '
             'shows that baseline IL9 levels can potentially serve as a '

{'abstract': 'Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises from a failure to maintain '
             'tolerance to specific β-cell antigens. Antigen-specific '

             'patients and in animal models of T1D are affected by a number of '
             'alterations, some due to genetic polymorphism. Combination of '

{'abstract': 'Epilepsy has been classically seen as a brain disorder resulting '
             'from abnormally enhanced neuronal excitability and '
             'synchronization. Although it has been described since antiquity, '
             'there are still significant challenges achieving the therapeutic '
             'goal of seizure freedom. Deep brain stimulation of the anterior '
             'nucleus of the thalamus has emerged as a promising therapy for '
             'focal drug-resistant epilepsy; the basic mechanism of action, '
             'however, remains unclear. Here, we show that desynchronization '
             'is a potential mechanism of deep brain stimulation of the '
             'anterior nucleus of the thalamus by studying local field '
             'potentials recordings from the cortex during high-frequency '
             'stimulation (130 Hz) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus in '
             'nine patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We demonstrate '
             'that high-frequency stimulation applied to the anterior nucleus '
             'of the thalamus desynchronizes ipsilateral hippocampal '
             'background electrical activity over a broad frequency range, and '
             'reduces pathological epileptic discharges including interictal '
             'spikes and high-frequency oscillations. Furthermore, '
             'high-frequency stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the '
             'thalamus is capable of decoupling large-scale neural activity '
             'involving the hippocampus and distributed cortical areas. We '
             'found that stimulation frequencies ranging from 15 to 45 Hz were '
             'associated with synchronization of hippocampal local field '
             'potentials, whereas higher frequencies (>45 Hz) promoted '
             'desynchronization of ipsilateral hippocampal activity. Moreover, '
             'reciprocal effective connectivity between the anterior nucleus '
             'of the thalamus and the hippocampus was demonstrated by '
             'hippocampal-thalamic evoked potentials and thalamic-hippocampal '
             'evoked potentials. In summary, high-frequency stimulation of the '
             'anterior nucleus of the thalamus is shown to desynchronize focal '
             'and large-scale epileptic networks, and here is proposed as the '
             'mechanism for reducing seizure generation and propagation. Our '
             'data also demonstrate position-specific correlation between deep '
             'brain stimulation applied to the anterior nucleus of the '

{'abstract': 'Introduction Autoinflammatory diseases can cause irreversible '
             'tissue damage due to systemic inflammation. Recently, the '
             'Autoinflammatory Disease Damage Index (ADDI) was developed. The '
             'ADDI is the first instrument to quantify damage in familial '
             'Mediterranean fever, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, '
             'mevalonate kinase deficiency and tumour necrosis factor '
             'receptor-associated periodic syndrome. The aim of this study was '
             'to validate this tool for its intended use in a '
             'clinical/research setting.  Methods The ADDI was scored on paper '
             'clinical cases by at least three physicians per case, '
             'independently of each other. Face and content validity were '
             'assessed by requesting comments on the ADDI. Reliability was '
             'tested by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient '
             '(ICC) using an ‘observer-nested-within-subject’ design. '
             'Construct validity was determined by correlating the ADDI score '
             'to the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of damage and disease '
             'activity. Redundancy of individual items was determined with '
             'Cronbach’s alpha.  Results The ADDI was validated on a total of '
             '110 paper clinical cases by 37 experts in autoinflammatory '
             'diseases. This yielded an ICC of 0.84 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.89). The '
             'ADDI score correlated strongly with PGA-damage (r=0.92, 95%\u2009'
             'CI 0.88 to 0.95) and was not strongly influenced by disease '
             'activity (r=0.395, 95%\u2009CI 0.21 to 0.55). After comments '
             'from disease experts, some item definitions were refined. The '
             'interitem correlation in all different categories was lower than '
             '0.7, indicating that there was no redundancy between individual '
             'damage items.  Conclusion The ADDI is a reliable and valid '
             'instrument to quantify damage in individual patients and can be '
             'used to compare disease outcomes in clinical studies.',

{'abstract': 'Purpose: The new classification announced by the World Health '
             'Organization in 2016 recognized five molecular subtypes of '
             'diffuse gliomas based on isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and '
             '1p/19q genotypes in addition to histologic phenotypes. We aim to '
             'determine whether clinical MRI can stratify these molecular '
             'subtypes to benefit the diagnosis and monitoring of gliomas.  '
             'Experimental Design: The data from 456 subjects with gliomas '
             'were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive. Overall, 214 '
             'subjects, including 106 cases of glioblastomas and 108 cases of '
             'lower grade gliomas with preoperative MRI, survival data, '
             'histology, IDH, and 1p/19q status were included. We proposed a '
             'three-level machine-learning model based on multimodal MR '
             'radiomics to classify glioma subtypes. An independent dataset '
             'with 70 glioma subjects was further collected to verify the '
             'model performance.  Results: The IDH and 1p/19q status of '
             'gliomas can be classified by radiomics and machine-learning '
             'approaches, with areas under ROC curves between 0.922 and 0.975 '
             'and accuracies between 87.7% and 96.1% estimated on the training '
             'dataset. The test on the validation dataset showed a comparable '
             'model performance with that on the training dataset, suggesting '
             'the efficacy of the trained classifiers. The classification of 5 '
             'molecular subtypes solely based on the MR phenotypes achieved an '
             '81.8% accuracy, and a higher accuracy of 89.2% could be achieved '
             'if the histology diagnosis is available.  Conclusions: The MR '
             'radiomics-based method provides a reliable alternative to '

{'abstract': 'Background: Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) correlates '
             'with platinum sensitivity in patients with ovarian cancer, which '
             'clinically is the most useful predictor of sensitivity to PARPi. '
             'To date, there are no reliable diagnostic tools to anticipate '
             'response to platinum-based chemotherapy, thus we aimed to '
             'develop an ex vivo functional HRD detection test that could '
             'predict both platinum-sensitivity and patient eligibility to '
             'targeted drug treatments.  Methods: We obtained a functional HR '
             'score by quantifying homologous recombination (HR) repair after '
             'ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage in primary ovarian cancer '
             'samples ( n = 32). Samples clustered in 3 categories: '
             'HR-deficient, HR-low, and HR-proficient. We analyzed the HR '
             'score association with platinum sensitivity and treatment '
             'response, platinum-free interval (PFI) and overall survival '
             '(OS), and compared it with other clinical parameters. In '
             'parallel, we performed DNA-sequencing of HR genes to assess if '
             'functional HRD can be predicted by currently offered genetic '
             'screening.  Results: Low HR scores predicted primary platinum '
             'sensitivity with high statistical significance ( P = 0.0103), '
             'associated with longer PFI (HR-deficient vs. HR-proficient: 531 '
             'vs. 53 days), and significantly correlated with improved OS (HR '
             'score <35 vs. ≥35, hazard ratio = 0.08, P = 0.0116). At the '
             'genomic level, we identified a few unclear mutations in HR genes '
             'and the mutational signature associated with HRD, but, overall, '
             'genetic screening failed to predict functional HRD.  '
             'Conclusions: We developed an ex vivo assay that detects tumor '
             'functional HRD and an HR score able to predict platinum '
             'sensitivity, which holds the clinically relevant potential to '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) genotyping is increasingly '
             'used in cancer care, but assay accuracy has been debated. '
             'Because most cfDNA is derived from peripheral blood cells (PBC), '
             'we hypothesized that nonmalignant mutations harbored by '
             'hematopoietic cells (clonal hematopoiesis, CH) could be a cause '
             'of false-positive plasma genotyping.  Experimental Design: We '
             'identified patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer '
             '(NSCLC) with KRAS, JAK2 , or TP53 mutations identified in cfDNA. '
             'With consent, PBC DNA was tested using droplet digital PCR '
             '(ddPCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) to test for '
             'CH-derived mutations.  Results: We first studied plasma ddPCR '
             'results from 58 patients with EGFR -mutant NSCLC. Two had KRAS '
             'G12X detected in cfDNA, and both were present in PBC, including '
             'one where the KRAS mutation was detected serially for 20 months. '
             'We then studied 143 plasma NGS results from 122 patients with '
             'NSCLC and identified 5 JAK2 V617F mutations derived from PBC. In '
             'addition, 108 TP53 mutations were detected in cfDNA; for 33 of '
             'the TP53 mutations, PBC and tumor NGS were available for '
             'comparison, and 5 were present in PBC but absent in tumor, '
             'consistent with CH.  Conclusions: We find that most JAK2 '
             'mutations, some TP53 mutations, and rare KRAS mutations detected '
             'in cfDNA are derived from CH not tumor. Clinicians ordering '
             'plasma genotyping must be prepared for the possibility that '
             'mutations detected in plasma, particularly in genes mutated in '
             'CH, may not represent true tumor genotype. Efforts to use plasma '
             'genotyping for cancer detection may need paired PBC genotyping '

             'from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting no pain), at 24 months. The '
             'threshold for minimal clinically important difference was set at '
             '15.  Results In the primary intention to treat analysis (ASD '
             'versus diagnostic arthroscopy), no clinically relevant between '
             'group differences were seen in the two primary outcomes at 24 '
             'months (mean change for ASD 36.0 at rest and 55.4 on activity; '
             'for diagnostic arthroscopy 31.4 at rest and 47.5 on activity). '
             'The observed mean difference between groups (ASD minus '
             'diagnostic arthroscopy) in pain VAS were −4.6 (95% confidence '
             'interval −11.3 to 2.1) points (P=0.18) at rest and −9.0 (−18.1 '

             'secondary comparison (ASD versus exercise therapy), '
             'statistically significant differences were found in favour of '

             'Correspondingly, 13 genera including Gemmiger and '
             'Parabacteroides were enriched in early HCC versus cirrhosis. '
             'Butyrate-producing genera were decreased, while genera '
             'producing-lipopolysaccharide were increased in early HCC versus '

             'through a fivefold cross-validation on a random forest model and '
             'achieved an area under the curve of 80.64% between 75 early HCC '
             'and 105 non-HCC samples. Notably, gut microbial markers '
             'validated strong diagnosis potential for early HCC and even '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Deletions or mutations in PTEN and TP53 tumor '
             'suppressor genes have been linked to lineage plasticity in '
             'therapy-resistant prostate cancer. Fusion-driven overexpression '
             'of the oncogenic transcription factor ERG is observed in '
             'approximately 50% of all prostate cancers, many of which also '
             'harbor PTEN and TP53 alterations. However, the role of ERG in '
             'lineage plasticity of PTEN / TP53 –altered tumors is unclear. '
             'Understanding the collective effect of multiple mutations within '
             'one tumor is essential to combat plasticity-driven therapy '
             'resistance.  Experimental Design: We generated a Pten -negative/ '

             'cancer and integrated RNA-sequencing with ERG chromatin '

             'inhibitor palbociclib in human prostate cancer cell lines, '

             'in TCGA, SU2C, and Beltran 2016 published patient cohorts and a '
             'human tissue microarray.  Results: Transgenic ERG expression in '
             'mice blocked Pten / Trp53 alteration–induced decrease of AR '
             'expression and downstream luminal epithelial genes. ERG directly '
             'suppressed expression of cell cycle–related genes, which induced '
             'RB hypophosphorylation and repressed E2F1-mediated expression of '

             'a pancreatic cancer patient-derived organoid (PDO) library that '
             'recapitulates the mutational spectrum and transcriptional '
             'subtypes of primary pancreatic cancer. New driver oncogenes were '
             'nominated and transcriptomic analyses revealed unique clusters. '
             'PDOs exhibited heterogeneous responses to standard-of-care '
             'chemotherapeutics and investigational agents. In a case study '
             'manner, we find that PDO therapeutic profiles paralleled patient '
             'outcomes and that PDOs enable longitudinal assessment of '
             'chemo-sensitivity and evaluation of synchronous metastases. We '
             'derived organoid-based gene expression signatures of '
             'chemo-sensitivity that predicted improved responses for many '
             'patients to chemotherapy in both the adjuvant and advanced '
             'disease settings. Finally, we nominated alternative treatment '
             'strategies for chemo-refractory PDOs using targeted agent '
             'therapeutic profiling. We propose that combined molecular and '
             'therapeutic profiling of PDOs may predict clinical response and '
             'enable prospective therapeutic selection.',

             'consumption were the mean from three assessments between 1985/88 '
             'and 1991/93 (midlife), categorised as abstinence, 1-14 '

             'dependence assessed in 1991/93; and hospital admission for '
             'alcohol related chronic diseases between 1991 and 2017.  Results '
             '397 cases of dementia were recorded over a mean follow-up of 23 '
             'years. Abstinence in midlife was associated with a higher risk '
             'of dementia (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to '
             '1.89) compared with consumption of 1-14 units/week. Among those '
             'drinking >14 units/week, a 7 unit increase in alcohol '
             'consumption was associated with a 17% (95% confidence interval '
             '4% to 32%) increase in risk of dementia. CAGE score >2 (hazard '
             'ratio 2.19, 1.29 to 3.71) and alcohol related hospital admission '
             '(4.28, 2.72 to 6.73) were also associated with an increased risk '
             'of dementia. Alcohol consumption trajectories from midlife to '
             'early old age showed long term abstinence (1.74, 1.31 to 2.30), '
             'decrease in consumption (1.55, 1.08 to 2.22), and long term '
             'consumption >14 units/week (1.40, 1.02 to 1.93) to be associated '
             'with a higher risk of dementia compared with long term '
             'consumption of 1-14 units/week. Analysis using multistate models '
             'suggested that the excess risk of dementia associated with '
             'abstinence in midlife was partly explained by cardiometabolic '
             'disease over the follow-up as the hazard ratio of dementia in '
             'abstainers without cardiometabolic disease was 1.33 (0.88 to '
             '2.02) compared with 1.47 (1.15 to 1.89) in the entire '
             'population.  Conclusion The risk of dementia was increased in '
             'people who abstained from alcohol in midlife or consumed >14 '
             'units/week. In several countries, guidelines define thresholds '
             'for harmful alcohol consumption much higher than 14 units/week. '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Although expression of CD30 is reported in a subset of '
             'adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cases, its '
             'clinicopathological significance is poorly understood. We aimed '
             'to characterize CD30-positive cells, and clarify their '
             'tumorigenic role in human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 '
             '(HTLV-1)-infected cells. Experimental Design: CD30-positive '
             'peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with '
             'differing HTLV-1 disease status were characterized, and the role '
             'of CD30 signaling was examined using HTLV-1-infected cell lines '
             'and primary cells. Results: CD30-positive cells were detected in '
             'all samples examined, and the marker was co-expressed with both '
             'CD25 and CD4. This cell population expanded in accordance with '
             'disease progression. CD30-positive cells showed polylobation, '
             'with some possessing "flower cell" features, active cycling and '
             'hyperploidy. CD30 stimulation of HTLV-1 infected cell lines '
             'induced these features and abnormal cell division, with '
             'polylobation found to be dependent on the activation of '
             'phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The results thus link the '
             'expression of CD30, which serves as a marker for HTLV-1 disease '
             'status, to an active proliferating cell fraction featuring '
             'polylobation and chromosomal aberrations. In addition, '
             'brentuximab vedotin, an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody conjugated '
             'with auristatin E, was found to reduce the CD30-positive cell '
             'fraction. Conclusions: Our results indicate that CD30-positive '
             'cells act as a reservoir for tumorigenic transformation and '
             'clonal expansion during HTLV-1 infection. The CD30-positive '
             'fraction may thus be a potential molecular target for those with '
             'differing HTLV-1 disease status.',

             'treatment options and poor prognosis, highlighting the need to '
             'understand genetic drivers of therapeutic vulnerabilities and/or '
             'prognostic predictors. We examined whether prospective molecular '
             'characterization of recurrent and metastatic disease revealed '
             'grade and histology-specific differences, facilitating '
             'enrollment onto clinical trials. Experimental Design: We '
             'integrated prospective clinical sequencing and '
             'immunohistochemical data with clinical and treatment histories '
             'for 197 tumors, profiled by MSK-IMPACT from 189 patients treated '
             'at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Results: Patients had advanced '
             'disease, high-grade histologies, and poor progression-free '
             'survival on first-line therapy (PFS1). Matched for histology and '
             'grade, the genomic landscape was similar to that of primary '
             'untreated disease profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). '
             'Using multiple complementary genomic and mutational '
             'signature-based methods, we identified patients with '
             'microsatellite instability (MSI), even when standard MMR protein '
             'immunohistochemical staining failed. Tumor and matched normal '
             'DNA sequencing identified rare pathogenic germline mutations in '
             'BRCA2 and MLH1. Clustering the pattern of DNA copy number '
             'alterations revealed a novel subset characterized by '
             'heterozygous losses across the genome and significantly worse '
             'outcomes compared to other clusters (median PFS1 9.6 months vs. '
             '17.0 and 17.4 months, p=0.006). Of the 68% of patients harboring '
             'potentially actionable mutations, 27% were enrolled to matched '
             'clinical trials; 47% of these achieved clinical benefit. '
             'Conclusions: Prospective clinical sequencing of advanced '
             'endometrial cancer can help refine prognosis aiding treatment '
             'decision-making by simultaneously detecting microsatellite '

{'abstract': 'Deep brain stimulation enables the delivery of therapeutic '
             'interventions to otherwise inaccessible areas of the brain '
             'while, at the same time, offering the unique opportunity to '
             'record from these same regions in awake patients. The posterior '
             'ventrolateral thalamus has become a reliable deep brain '
             'stimulation target for medically-refractory patients suffering '
             'from essential tremor. However, the contribution of the thalamus '
             'in essential tremor, and even whether posterior ventrolateral '
             'thalamus is the optimal target, remains a matter of ongoing '
             'debate. There are several lines of evidence supporting clusters '
             'of activity within the posterior ventrolateral thalamus that are '
             'important for tremor emergence. In this study we sought to map '
             'the functional properties of these clusters through '
             'microelectrode recordings during deep brain stimulation surgery. '
             'Data were obtained from 10 severely affected patients with '
             'essential tremor (12 hemispheres) undergoing deep brain '
             'stimulation surgery. Our results demonstrate power and coherence '
             'maxima located in the inferior posterior ventrolateral thalamus '
             'and immediate ventral region. Moreover, we identified distinct '
             'yet overlapping clusters of predominantly efferent (driving) and '
             'afferent (feedback) activity, with a preference for more '
             'efferent contributors, consistent with a net role in the driving '
             'of tremor output. Finally, we demonstrate that resolvable '
             'thalamic spiking activity directly relates to background '
             'activity and that the strength of tremor may be dictated by '
             'phase relationships between efferent and afferent pockets in the '
             'posterior ventrolateral thalamus. Taken together, these results '
             'provide important evidence for the role of the inferior '
             'posterior ventrolateral thalamus and its border region in '
             'essential tremor pathophysiology. Such results progress our '
             'mechanistic understanding and promote the adoption of '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Highly-aggressive triple negative breast cancers '
             '(TNBCs) lack validated therapeutic targets and have high risk of '
             'metastatic disease. Folate Receptor alpha (FRα) is a central '
             'mediator of cell growth regulation that could serve as an '
             'important target for cancer therapy. Experimental Design: We '
             'evaluated FRα expression in breast cancers by genomic (N = 3414) '
             'and immunohistochemical (N = 323) analyses and its association '
             'with clinical parameters and outcomes. We measured the '
             'functional contributions of FRα in TNBC biology by RNA '
             'interference and the anti-tumor functions of an antibody '
             'recognizing FRα (MOv18-IgG1), in vitro and in human TNBC '
             'xenograft models. Results: FRα is overexpressed in significant '
             'proportions of aggressive basal like/TNBC tumors, and in '
             'post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy-residual disease associated with a '
             'high risk of relapse. Expression is associated with worse '

             'methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, involved in folate '

             'anti-FRα antibody (MOv18-IgG1) conjugated with a Src inhibitor '

{'abstract': 'Although treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors provides '
             'promising benefit for cancer patients, optimal use is encumbered '
             'by high resistance rates and requires a thorough understanding '
             'of resistance mechanisms. We observed that tumors treated with '
             'PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies develop resistance through the '
             'up-regulation of CD38, which is induced by all-trans retinoic '

             'adenosine receptor blockade are effective strategies to overcome '

{'abstract': 'Objective Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive, relapsing '
             'inflammatory disorder of the pancreas, which often develops in '
             'the background of genetic susceptibility. Recently, '
             'loss-of-function mutations in CPA1 , which encodes the digestive '
             'enzyme carboxypeptidase A1, were described in sporadic early '
             'onset cases and in hereditary pancreatitis. Mutation-induced '
             'misfolding of CPA1 and associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) '
             'stress was suggested as potential disease mechanism; however, in '
             'vivo evidence has been lacking. The objective of the present '
             'study was to create a mouse model that recapitulates features of '
             'CPA1 -associated chronic pancreatitis.  Design We knocked-in the '
             'most frequently occurring p.N256K human CPA1 mutation to the '
             'mouse Cpa1 locus. Mutant mice were characterised with respect to '
             'pancreas pathology and ER stress and compared with C57BL/6N and '
             'CPA1 null control mice.  Results In the CPA1 N256K mutant mice, '

             'progressive acinar cell atrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration, '
             'fibrosis and acinar-ductal metaplasia. In contrast, similarly to '
             'the C57BL/6N mice, the CPA1 null control strain exhibited no '
             'signs of pancreatic disease. Mutation p.N256K induced misfolding '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: The MEK inhibitor trametinib radiosensitizes '
             'KRAS-mutant NSCLC and is being tested clinically with '
             'chemoradiation. However, variability in response to trametinib '
             'suggests that additional pathways are involved. The mechanism of '
             'resistance to trametinib radiosensitization is still unknown. '
             'Experimental Design: We used a panel of KRAS -mutant NSCLC cells '
             'and tested the radiosensitization effects of trametinib by '
             'clonogenic survival assay. Then we investigated the mechanisms '
             'underlying the resistance to the combination therapy through '
             'several knockout and overexpression systems. Finally, we '
             'validated our findings in a syngeneic mouse models in a '
             'treatment setting that mimicked the standard of care in the '
             'clinic. Results: Radiosensitization by trametinib was effective '
             'only in KRAS-LKB1 -mutated cells with wildtype p53, and that '
             'restoring LKB1 expression in those cells blocked that '
             'sensitization. Trametinib and radiation both induced senescence '
             'in a p53-dependent manner, but in WT LKB1 cells the combination '
             'also activated the AMPK-autophagy pathway to rescue damaged '
             'cells from senescence. LKB1 knockout or autophagy inhibition in '
             'WT LKB1 cells potentiated trametinib radiosensitization. In '
             'syngeneic animal models of Kras -mutant lung tumors, Lkb1 '
             '-knockout tumors were resistant to trametinib and chemoradiation '
             'given separately, but the combination greatly controlled tumor '
             'growth and prolonged survival. Conclusions: The LKB1 mutation in '
             'KRAS -mutant NSCLC conferred enhanced radiosensitization in '
             'combination with trametinib. The WT LKB1 could activate '
             'autophagy through AMPK pathway to induce resistance to the '
             'combination of trametinib and radiation. The KRAS-LKB1 mutation '
             'could potentially be a biomarker to select patients for '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: MET inhibitors can be effective therapies in patients '
             'with MET exon 14 (METex14) mutant non-small cell lung cancer '
             '(NSCLC). However, long term efficacy is limited by the '
             'development of drug resistance. In this study, we characterize '
             'acquired amplification of wild type (WT) KRAS as a molecular '
             'mechanism behind crizotinib resistance in three cases of METex14 '
             'mutant NSCLC and propose a combination therapy to target it. '
             'Experimental Design: The patient-derived cell line and xenograft '
             '(PDX) DFCI358 were established from a crizotinib-resistant '
             'METex14 mutant patient tumor with massive focal amplification of '
             'WT KRAS. To characterize the mechanism of KRAS-mediated '
             'resistance, molecular signaling was analyzed in the parental '
             'cell line and its KRAS siRNA-transfected derivative. Sensitivity '
             'of the cell line to ligand stimulation was assessed and '
             'KRAS-dependent expression of EGFR ligands was quantified. Drug '
             'combinations were screened for efficacy in vivo and in vitro '
             'using viability and apoptotic assays. Results: KRAS '
             'amplification is a recurrent genetic event in '
             'crizotinib-resistant METex14 mutant NSCLC. The key '
             'characteristics of this genetic signature include uncoupling MET '
             'from downstream effectors, relative insensitivity to dual '
             'MET/MEK inhibition due to compensatory induction of PI3K '
             'signaling, KRAS-induced expression of EGFR ligands and '
             'hypersensitivity to ligand-dependent and independent activation, '
             'and reliance on PI3K signaling upon MET inhibition. Conclusions: '
             'Using patient-derived cell line and xenografts, we characterize '
             'the mechanism of crizotinib resistance mediated by KRAS '
             'amplification in METex14 mutant NSCLC and demonstrate the '
             'superior efficacy of the dual MET/PI3K inhibition as a '
             'therapeutic strategy addressing this resistance mechanism.',

{'abstract': 'Objective A healthy lifestyle is the first-line treatment in '
             'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but specific dietary '
             'recommendations are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to determine '
             'whether dietary macronutrient composition is associated with '
             'NAFLD.  Design Participants from the Rotterdam Study were '
             'assessed on (1) average intake of macronutrients (protein, '
             'carbohydrate, fat, fibre) using a Food Frequency Questionnaire '
             'and (2) NAFLD presence using ultrasonography, in absence of '
             'excessive alcohol, steatogenic drugs and viral hepatitis. '
             'Macronutrients were analysed using the nutrient density method '
             'and ranked (Q1–Q4). Logistic regression analyses were adjusted '
             'for sociodemographic, lifestyle and metabolic covariates. '
             'Moreover, analyses were adjusted for and stratified by body mass '
             'index (BMI) (25\u2009kg/m2). Also, substitution models were '
             'built.  Results In total, 3882 participants were included (age '
             '70±9, 58% female). NAFLD was present in 1337 (34%) participants '
             'of whom 132 were lean and 1205 overweight. Total protein was '
             'associated with overweight NAFLD after adjustment for '
             'sociodemographic and lifestyle covariates (ORQ4vsQ1 1.40; '
             '95%\u2009CI 1.11 to 1.77). This association was driven by animal '
             'protein (ORQ4vsQ1 1.54; 95%\u2009CI 1.20 to 1.98). After '
             'adjustment for metabolic covariates, only animal protein '
             'remained associated with overweight NAFLD (ORQ4vsQ1 1.36; '
             '95%\u2009CI 1.05 to 1.77). Monosaccharides and disaccharides '
             'were associated with lower overall NAFLD prevalence (ORQ4vsQ1 '
             '0.66; 95%\u2009CI 0.52 to 0.83) but this effect diminished after '
             'adjustment for metabolic covariates and BMI. No consistent '
             'associations were observed for fat subtypes or fibre. There were '
             'no substitution effects.  Conclusion This large population-based '
             'study shows that high animal protein intake is associated with '
             'NAFLD in overweight, predominantly aged Caucasians, '
             'independently of well-known risk factors. Contrary to previous '
             'literature, our results do not support a harmful association of '
             'monosaccharides and disaccharides with NAFLD.',

             'relevance of heterozygous carriage remains unclear. Hence, we '
             'evaluated the impact of the two most relevant AAT variants '
             '(‘Pi*Z’ and ‘Pi*S’), present in up to 10% of Caucasians, on '
             'subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or '

             'of 2462 people with chronic alcohol misuse, both cohorts '
             'comprising cases with cirrhosis and controls without cirrhosis. '
             'Genotyping for the Pi*Z and Pi*S variants was performed.  '
             'Results The Pi*Z variant presented in 13.8% of patients with '

             'Correspondingly, alcohol misusers carrying the Pi*Z variant were '

             'response to sunitinib given before planned nephrectomy in '
             'metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients. Experimental '
             'Design: This French multicentre, prospective, open-label, phase '
             'II trial ([NCT00930345][1]) included treatment-naïve patients '
             'with clear-cell mRCC. Patients received two cycles of sunitinib '
             'before nephrectomy. The primary objective was to evaluate the '
             'potential of circulating angiogenesis-related biomarkers '
             'measured before and on treatment for identifying responders '
             'based on primary renal tumor (PRT) size change. Secondary '
             'objectives were to evaluate the ability of biomarkers to predict '
             'progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). '
             'Results: Thirty-two patients were enrolled. Median PFS was 4.5 '
             'months and median OS was 12.4 months. OS was significantly '
             'longer in responding patients (28.8 vs. 11.1 months; P =0.03). '
             'Of 27 patients evaluable for PRT response, nine (33.3%) had a '
             '³10% decrease in PRT size. Baseline biomarkers significantly '
             'associated with outcome were endothelial progenitor cells (PRT '
             'response); vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, stromal '
             'cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), soluble VEGF receptors (sVEGFR)1 '
             'and 2 (PFS); and SDF‑1 and sVEGFR1 (OS). During treatment, '
             'changes in biomarkers associated with outcome were SDF-1 and '
             'platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB (PRT response); sVEGFR2 '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: The BRAFV600E oncogene modulates the papillary thyroid '
             'carcinoma (PTC) microenvironment, in which pericytes are '
             'critical regulators of tyrosine-kinase (TK)-dependent signaling '
             'pathways. Although BRAFV600E and TK inhibitors are available, '
             'their efficacy as bimodal therapeutic agents in BRAFV600E-PTC is '
             'still unknown. Experimental Design: We assessed the effects of '
             'vemurafenib (BRAFV600E inhibitor) and sorafenib (TKI) as single '
             'agents or in combination in BRAFWT/V600E-PTC and BRAFWT/WT cells '
             'using cell-autonomous, pericyte co-culture, and an orthotopic '
             'mouse model. We also used BRAFWT/V600E-PTC and BRAFWT/WT-PTC '
             'clinical samples to identify differentially expressed genes '
             'fundamental to tumor microenvironment. Results: Combined therapy '
             'blocked tumor cell proliferation, increased cell death, and '
             'decreased motility via BRAFV600E inhibition in thyroid tumor '
             'cells in vitro . Vemurafenib produces cytostatic effects in '
             'orthotopic tumors, whereas combined therapy (likely reflecting '
             'sorafenib activity) generates biological fluctuations with tumor '
             'inhibition alternating with tumor growth. We demonstrate that '
             'pericytes secrete TSP-1 and TGFβ1, and induce the rebound of '
             'pERK1/2, pAKT and pSMAD3 levels to overcome the inhibitory '
             'effects of the targeted therapy in PTC cells. This leads to '
             'increased BRAFV600E-PTC cell survival and cell death '
             'refractoriness. We find that BRAFWT/V600E-PTC clinical samples '
             'are enriched in pericytes, and TSP1 and TGFβ1 expression evoke '
             'gene-regulatory networks and pathways in the microenvironment '
             'essential for BRAFWT/V600E-PTC cell survival. Critically, '
             'antagonism of the TSP-1/TGFβ1 axis reduces tumor cell growth and '
             'overcomes drug resistance. Conclusions: Pericytes shield '
             'BRAFV600E-PTC cells from targeted therapy via TSP-1 and TGFβ1, '
             'suggesting this axis as a new therapeutic target for overcoming '
             'resistance to BRAFV600E and TK inhibitors.',

{'abstract': 'Real-world data (RWD) has been defined as data generated outside '
             'of traditional randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Though RWD has '
             'received increasing attention from regulatory authorities and '
             'professional societies, dividing evidence into that derived from '
             '‘real-world’ vs. ‘non-real-world’ sources provides only one '
             'element of a much larger framework for evidence evaluation. '
             'Evidence should be evaluated on the source of the data, the '
             'method of treatment allocation (whether any intervention being '
             'evaluated was assigned or simply observed as used in practice) '
             'and the context in which the evidence was generated (overall '
             'study design). Under this framework, RWD refers only to data '
             'source, and a study incorporates RWD when it primarily uses data '
             'collected for non-research purposes, such as insurance claims '
             'data or the electronic health record, regardless of study '
             'design. Separation of study design, data source, and context '
             'enables parallel evaluation of two critical elements: (i) '
             'whether a study can support claims of causal inference, which '
             'can be assured with a high degree of confidence only in studies '
             'where patients are assigned treatments by protocol; and (ii) '
             'whether the study population and clinical context mirror '
             'clinical practice, a strength of observational studies using '
             'data from clinical practice or administrative claims. In this '
             'review, we describe the strengths and weaknesses of '
             'observational and non-observational studies, and studies '
             'involving RWD and non-RWD, through the lens of anticoagulation '
             'for atrial fibrillation (AF). Observational studies employing '
             'RWD are useful for describing how oral anticoagulants are used '
             'in clinical practice, but generally cannot be used to make '
             'claims regarding comparative treatment effects. Questions '
             'regarding treatment effect generally are best answered through '
             'an RCT, and additional pragmatic RCTs are needed to compare '

             'faecal samples were collected. Patients were randomised to FMT '
             'or placebo capsules for 12 days and followed for 6 months. Study '
             'visits were performed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months, where '
             'patients were asked to register their symptoms using the '
             'IBS-severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) and IBS-specific quality '
             'of life (IBS-QoL). Prior to each visit, faecal samples were '
             'collected.  Results A significant difference in improvement in '
             'IBS-SSS score was observed 3 months after treatment (p=0.012) '
             'favouring placebo. This was similar for IBS-QoL data after 3 '
             'months (p=0.003) favouring placebo. Patients receiving FMT '
             'capsules had an increase in faecal microbial biodiversity while '
             'placebos did not.  Conclusion In this randomised double-blinded '
             'placebo-controlled study, we found that FMT changed gut '
             'microbiota in patients with IBS. But patients in the placebo '
             'group experienced greater symptom relief compared with the FMT '
             'group after 3 months. Altering the gut microbiota is not enough '
             'to obtain clinical improvement in IBS. However, different study '

{'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Common resistance mechanisms to endocrine therapy '
             '(ET) in estrogen receptor (ER) positive metastatic breast '
             'cancers include, among others, ER loss and acquired activating '
             'mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the ER gene ( ESR1LBDm '
             '). ESR1 mutational mediated resistance may be overcome by '
             'selective ER degraders (SERDs). During the first-in-human study '
             'of oral SERD AZD9496, early changes in circulating tumor cells '
             '(CTC) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were explored as '
             'potential non-invasive tools, alongside paired tumor biopsies, '
             'to assess pharmacodynamics and early efficacy. METHODS: CTC were '
             'enumerated/phenotyped for ER and Ki67 using CellSearch® in '
             'serial blood draws. ctDNA was assessed for the most common '
             'ESR1LBDm by droplet digital PCR (BioRad). RESULTS: Before '
             'starting AZD9496, 11/43 (25%) patients had ≥5CTC/7.5mL whole '
             'blood (WB), none of whom underwent reduction to <5CTC/7.5mL WB '
             'on C1D15. 5/11 patients had baseline CTC-ER+, 2 of whom had '
             'CTC-ER+ reduction. CTC-Ki67 status did not change appreciably. '
             'Patients with ≥5CTC/7.5mL WB pre-treatment had worse '
             'progression-free survival (PFS) than patients with <5CTC '
             '(p=0.0003). Fourteen of 45 (31%) patients had ESR1LBDm + ctDNA '
             'at baseline, 5 of whom had ≥2 unique mutations. Baseline '
             'ESR1LBDm status was not prognostic. Patients with persistently '
             'elevated CTC and/or ESR1LBDm + ctDNA at C1D15 had worse PFS than '
             'patients who did not (p=0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CTC at '
             'baseline was a strong prognostic factor in this cohort. Early '
             'on-treatment changes were observed in CTC-ER+ and ESR1LBDm + '

{'abstract': 'Abstract Introduction: Abemaciclib, a dual inhibitor of '
             'cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, has demonstrated preclinical '
             'activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A multicenter, '
             'nonrandomized, open-label phase 1b study was conducted to test '
             'safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and '
             'preliminary antitumor activity of abemaciclib in combination '
             'with other therapies for treatment in patients with metastatic '
             'NSCLC. Methods: An initial dose escalation phase was used to '
             'determine the MTD of twice-daily oral abemaciclib (150, 200 mg) '
             'plus pemetrexed, gemcitabine, or ramucirumab, followed by an '
             'expansion phase for each drug combination. Pemetrexed and '
             'gemcitabine were administered according to label. The '
             'abemaciclib plus ramucirumab study examined two dosing '
             'schedules. Results: The three study parts enrolled 86 patients; '
             'all received ≥1 dose of combination therapy. Across arms, the '
             'most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue, '
             'diarrhea, neutropenia, decreased appetite, and nausea. The trial '
             'did not identify an abemaciclib MTD for the combination with '
             'pemetrexed or gemcitabine but did so for the combination of '
             'abemaciclib with days 1,8 ramucirumab (8mg/kg). Plasma sample '
             'analysis showed that abemaciclib did not influence the '
             'pharmacokinetics of the combination agents and the combinations '
             'agents did not affect abemaciclib exposure. The disease control '
             'rate was 57% for patients treated with abemaciclib-pemetrexed, '
             '25% for abemaciclib-gemcitabine, and 54% for '
             'abemaciclib-ramucirumab. Median progression-free survival was '
             '5.55, 1.58, and 4.83 months, respectively. Conclusions: '
             'Abemaciclib demonstrated an acceptable safety profile when dosed '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Despite the challenge to directly target mutant KRAS '
             'due to its high GTP affinity, some agents are under development '
             'against downstream signaling pathways, such as MEK inhibitors. '
             'However, it remains controversial whether MEK inhibitors can '
             'boost current chemotherapy in KRAS -mutant lung tumors in '
             'clinic. Considering the genomic heterogeneity among patients '
             'with lung cancer, it is valuable to test potential therapeutics '
             'in KRAS mutation–driven mouse models.  Experimental Design: We '
             'first compared the pERK1/2 level in lung cancer samples with '
             'different KRAS substitutions and generated a new genetically '
             'engineered mouse model whose tumor was driven by KRAS G12C, the '
             'most common KRAS mutation in lung cancer. Next, we evaluated the '
             'efficacy of selumetinib or its combination with chemotherapy, in '
             'KRASG12C tumors compared with KRASG12D tumors. Moreover, we '
             'generated KRASG12C/p53R270H model to explore the role of a '
             'dominant negative p53 mutation detected in patients in '
             'responsiveness to MEK inhibition.  Results: We determined higher '
             'pERK1/2 in KRASG12C lung tumors compared with KRASG12D. Using '
             'mouse models, we further identified that KRASG12C tumors are '
             'significantly more sensitive to selumetinib compared with '
             'KrasG12D tumors. MEK inhibition significantly increased '
             'chemotherapeutic efficacy and progression-free survival of '
             'KRASG12C mice. Interestingly, p53 co-mutation rendered KRASG12C '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a '
             'heterogeneous group of pathologically expanded myeloid cells '
             'with immunosuppressive activity. In human disease, three major '
             'MDSC subpopulations can be defined as monocytic (M-MDSC), '
             'granulocytic [polymorphonuclear-MDSC (PMN-MDSC)], and early '
             'stage (e-MDSC), which lacks myeloid lineage markers of the '

             'relevance of each of these subsets in patients with solid '
             'cancer.  Experimental Design: The frequency of MDSC subsets in '
             'the peripheral blood was determined by flow cytometry in a '
             'cohort of 49 patients with advanced head and neck cancer (HNC) '

{'abstract': 'Purpose:Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a common '
             'cancer worldwide, is etiologically associated with tobacco use, '
             'high alcohol consumption and high risk human papillomaviruses '
             '(HPV). The Notch signaling pathway, which is involved in cell '
             'differentiation decisions with differential downstream targets '
             'and effects depending on tissue type and developmental stage, '
             'has been implicated in human HNSCC. Notch1 is among the most '
             'frequently mutated genes in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative '
             'HNSCC. These mutations are predicted to inactivate the function '
             'of Notch. Other studies have argued the opposite - that Notch '
             'signaling is increased in HNSCC. Experimental Design:To assess '
             'the role of Notch signaling in HPV-positive and HPV-negative '
             'HNSCC, we utilized genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models for '
             'conventional keratinizing HNSCC, in which either HPV16 E6 and E7 '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi) are effective against EGFR '
             'mutant lung cancers. The efficacy of these drugs however is '
             'mitigated by the outgrowth of resistant cells, most often driven '
             'by a secondary acquired mutation in EGFR, T790M . We recently '
             'demonstrated that T790M can arise de novo during treatment (Hata '
             'et al., Nature Medicine 2016); it follows that one potential '
             'therapeutic strategy to thwart resistance would be identifying '
             'and eliminating these cells (referred to as drug tolerant cells '
             '(DTCs)) prior to acquiring secondary mutations like T790M . '
             'Experimental Design: We have developed DTCs to EGFRi in EGFR '
             'mutant lung cancer cell lines. Subsequent analyses of DTCs '
             'included RNA-seq, high-content microscopy, and protein '
             'translational assays. Based on these results, we tested the '
             'ability of MCL-1 BH3 mimetics to combine with EGFR inhibitors to '
             'eliminate DTCs and shrink EGFR mutant lung cancer tumors in vivo '
             '. Results: We demonstrate surviving EGFR mutant lung cancers '
             'upregulate the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 in response to '
             'short-term EGFRi treatment. Mechanistically, DTCs undergo a '
             'protein biosynthesis enrichment resulting in increased '
             'mTORC1-mediated mRNA translation of MCL-1, revealing a novel '
             'mechanism in which lung cancer cells adapt to short-term '
             'pressures of apoptosis-inducing kinase inhibitors. Moreover, '
             'MCL-1 is a key molecule governing the emergence of early EGFR '

{'abstract': 'Purpose: Following cytotoxic therapy, 70% of patients with human '
             'papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal head and neck '
             'squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are alive at 5 years compared to '
             '30% of those with similar HPV-negative cancer, which is thought '
             'to be due to dysregulation of DNA repair. Loss of transforming '
             'growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling is a poorly studied consequence '
             'of HPV that could contribute to this phenotype. Experimental '
             'Design: Human HNSCC cell lines (n=9), patient-derived xenografts '
             '(n=9), tissue microarray (n=194), TCGA expression data and '
             'primary tumor specimens (n=10) were used to define the '
             'relationship between TGFβ competency, response to DNA damage, '
             'and type of DNA repair. Results: Analysis of HNSCC specimens in '
             'situ and in vitro showed that HPV associates with loss of TGFβ '
             'signaling that increases the response to radiation or cisplatin. '
             'TGFβ suppressed miR-182 that inhibited both BRCA1, necessary for '
             'homologous recombination repair, and FOXO3, which is required '
             'for ATM kinase activity. TGFβ signaling blockade by either HPV '
             'or inhibitors released this control, compromised HRR and '
             'increased response to PARP inhibition. Antagonizing miR-182 '
             'rescued the homologous recombination deficit in HPV+ cells. Loss '
             'of TGFβ signaling unexpectedly increased error-prone, '
             'alternative end-joining repair. Conclusions: HPV-positive HNSCC '
             'cells are unresponsive to TGFβ. Abrogated TGFβ signaling '
             'compromises homologous recombination and shifts reliance on '
             'alt-EJ repair that provides a mechanistic basis for sensitivity '
             'to PARP inhibitors. The effect of HPV in HNSCC provides critical '
             "validation of TGFβ's role in DNA repair proficiency and further "

             'collected from 164 individuals positive for the SCN5A-1795insD '

             'suffered life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Of these, 18 '
             'were aged >40\u2009years, a high proportion of which had a '
             'clinical diagnosis of hypertension and/or cardiac hypertrophy. '
             'While pacemaker implantation was highly protective in preventing '
             'bradycardia-related SCD in young mutation-positive patients, '
             'seven of them aged >40 experienced life-threatening arrhythmic '

             'diagnosis of hypertension/hypertrophy, pointing to a modulatory '

             'mice carrying the homologous mutation (Scn5a1798insD/+) caused '
             'SCD and excessive conduction disturbances, confirming a '

             'The deleterious effects of the interaction between hypertrophy '

             'broad search in electronic databases until August 2017 was '
             'performed. Studies on the aforementioned techniques in >100 '
             'patients with stable CAD that utilized either ICA or ICA with '
             'FFR measurement as reference, were included. Study-level data '
             'was pooled using a hierarchical bivariate random-effects model '
             'and likelihood ratios were obtained for each technique. The PTP '
             'ranges for each technique to rule-in or rule-out significant CAD '
             'were defined. A total of 28664 patients from 132 studies that '
             'used ICA as reference and 4131 from 23 studies using FFR, were '
             'analysed. Stress ECG can rule-in and rule-out anatomically '
             'significant CAD only when PTP is ≥80% (76–83) and ≤19% (15–25), '
             'respectively. Coronary computed tomography angiography is able '
             'to rule-in anatomic CAD at a PTP ≥58% (45–70) and rule-out at a '
             'PTP ≤80% (65–94). The corresponding PTP values for functionally '
             'significant CAD were ≥75% (67–83) and ≤57% (40–72) for CCTA, and '
             '≥71% (59–81) and ≤27 (24–31) for ICA, demonstrating poorer '
             'performance of anatomic imaging against FFR. In contrast, '
             'functional imaging techniques (PET, stress CMR, and SPECT) are '
             'able to rule-in functionally significant CAD when PTP is ≥46–59% '
             'and rule-out when PTP is ≤34–57%.ConclusionThe various '

             'CAD. Stress ECG appears to have very limited diagnostic power. '
             'The selection of a diagnostic technique for any given patient to '

             'Italy between 2001 and 2006, 5000 ECGs including 17 with '
             'LQTS-causing mutation identified by genotyping were studied '
             'using four QT correction formulae [Bazett’s (QTcB), Fridericia’s '
             '(QTcF), Framingham (QTcL), and Hodges (QTcH)]. A '
             'neonate-specific exponential correction (QTcNeo) was derived '
             'using 2500 randomly selected ECGs and validated for accuracy in '
             'the remaining 2500 ECGs. Digital ECGs were recorded between the '
             '15th and 25th day of life; QT interval was measured manually in '
             'leads II, V5, and V6. To assess the ability to provide heart '
             'rate (HR) independent QT correction, regression analysis of the '
             'QTc-HR plots for all 5000 ECGs with each correction formula was '
             'done. QTcB provided the most HR independent correction with a '
             'slope closest to zero (slope +0.086\u2009ms/b.p.m.) followed by '
             'QTcF (slope −0.308\u2009ms/b.p.m.), QTcL (slope −0.364\u2009'
             'ms/b.p.m.), and QTcH (slope +0.962\u2009ms/b.p.m.). The QTc-HR '
             'slope of QTcNeo (QT/RR0.467) was similar to QTcB. The ability to '
             'correctly identify neonates with LQTS was best with QTcB, QTcF, '
             'and QTcNeo (comparable areas under the receiver operating '
             'characteristic curves) with positive predictive value of 39–40% '
             'and sensitivity of 100%. Cut-off values were 460\u2009ms for '
             'QTcB, 394\u2009ms for QTcF, and 446\u2009ms for '
             'QTcNeo.ConclusionsThe Bazett’s correction provides an effective '
             'HR independent QT correction and also accurately identifies the '
             'neonates affected by LQTS. It can be used with confidence in '
             'neonates, although other methods could also be used with '
             'appropriate cut-offs.',

             'therapies. A key concept in this review is that HFpEF is a '
             'haemodynamic condition wherein the heart fails to keep up with '
             'the circulatory demands of the body, or does so at the expense '
             'of raised left ventricular filling pressures. We, therefore, '
             'propose that the ‘final common pathway’ for development of '
             'congestion, i.e. basic haemodynamic mechanisms of increased left '
             'ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left atrial hypertension, '
             'pulmonary venous congestion, and plasma volume expansion, '
             'represents important initial targets for therapy in HFpEF. '
             'Accordingly, we group this review into six mechanisms '
             'translating into potential therapies for HFpEF: beginning with '
             'three haemodynamic mechanisms (left atrial hypertension, '
             'pulmonary hypertension, and plasma volume expansion), and '

             'might confound the estimate of the calculated efficacy of the '

{'abstract': 'Due to the cyclic function of the human heart, pressure and flow '

             'available, related to development and treatment of heart failure '

{'abstract': 'AimsSystematically reviewing the literature found orthostatic '

             'highest risk, the hypertensive oldest-old. Our aim was to '
             'analyse the relationship between OH and incident cognitive '
             'decline or dementia in this group and to synthesize the evidence '
             'base overall.Method and resultsParticipants aged ≥80\u2009years, '
             'with hypertension, were from the Hypertension in the Very '
             'Elderly Trial (HYVET) cohort. Orthostatic hypotension was '
             'defined as a fall of ≥15\u2009mmHg in systolic and or ≥7\u2009'
             'mmHg in diastolic pressure after 2 min standing from a sitting '
             'position. Subclinical orthostatic hypotension with symptoms '
             '(SOH) was defined as a fall <OH but with unsteadiness, '
             'light-headedness, or faintness in the week before blood pressure '
             'measurement. Proportional hazard regression was used to examine '
             'the relationship between baseline OH, SOH, and cognitive '
             'outcomes. There were 3121 in the analytical sample, 538 with OH. '
             'Orthostatic hypotension was associated with increased risk of '
             'cognitive decline (906 events), hazard ratio (HR) 1.36 (95% '
             'confidence interval 1.14–1.59). For incident dementia (241 '
             'events), HR 1.34 (0.98–1.84). When competing risk of '
             'cardiovascular events were taken into account results were HR '
             '1.39 (1.19–1.62) and HR 1.34 (1.05–1.73), respectively. '
             'Subclinical orthostatic hypotension was associated with an '
             'increased risk of cognitive decline HR 1.56 (1.12–2.17) and '
             'dementia HR 1.79 (1.00–3.20). Combining the results from the '
             'HYVET cohort in a meta-analysis with the existing published '
             'literature in this area found a 21% (9–35%) increased risk of '

{'abstract': 'AimsHypertension (HTN) is a well-known contributor to '

             'been suggested between blood pressure (BP) and clinical outcomes '
             'in different studies. However, there is little information about '
             'the significance of BP on the outcomes of patients with coronary '
             'artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. This study '
             'aimed to determine the relationship between BP and mortality '

             'therapy alone (MED) in the STICH (Surgical Treatment for '
             'Ischaemic Heart Failure) trial. Landmark analyses were performed '
             'starting at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\u2009years after randomization, in '
             'which previous systolic BP values were averaged and related to '
             'subsequent mortality through the end of follow-up with a median '
             'of 9.8\u2009years. Neither a previous history of HTN nor '
             'baseline BP had any significant influence on long-term mortality '
             'outcomes, nor did they have a significant interaction with MED '
             'or CABG treatment. The landmark analyses showed a progressive '
             'U-shaped relationship that became strongest at 5\u2009years (χ2 '

             '(DBP) and outcomes was similar. The most favourable outcomes '
             'were observed in the SBP range 120–130, and DBP 75–85\u2009mmHg, '

             'baseline best predict cognitive decline, during a 5-year '
             'follow-up period. A total of 234 patients with clinically '
             'definite multiple sclerosis and 60 healthy control subjects were '
             'examined twice, with a 5-year interval (mean = 4.9 years, '
             'standard deviation = 0.9). An extensive neuropsychological '
             'evaluation was performed at both time points and the reliable '
             'change index was computed to evaluate cognitive decline. Both '
             'whole-brain and regional MRI (3 T) measures were assessed at '
             'baseline, including white matter lesion volume, diffusion-based '
             'white matter integrity, cortical and deep grey matter volume. '
             'Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine which '
             'baseline measures best predicted cognitive decline in the entire '
             'sample as well as in early relapsing-remitting (symptom duration '
             '<10 years), late relapsing-remitting (symptom duration ≥10 '
             'years) and progressive phenotypes. At baseline, patients with '
             'multiple sclerosis had a mean disease duration of 14.8 (standard '
             'deviation = 8.4) years and 96/234 patients (41%) were classified '
             'as cognitively impaired. A total of 66/234 patients (28%) '
             'demonstrated cognitive decline during follow-up, with higher '
             'frequencies in progressive compared to relapsing-remitting '
             'patients: 18/33 secondary progressive patients (55%), 10/19 '
             'primary progressive patients (53%) and 38/182 '
             'relapsing-remitting patients (21%). A prediction model that '
             'included only whole-brain MRI measures (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.22, P '
             '< 0.001) showed cortical grey matter volume as the only '
             'significant MRI predictor of cognitive decline, while a '
             'prediction model that assessed regional MRI measures (Nagelkerke '
             'R2 = 0.35, P < 0.001) indicated integrity loss of the anterior '
             'thalamic radiation, lesions in the superior longitudinal '
             'fasciculus and temporal atrophy as significant MRI predictors '
             'for cognitive decline. Disease stage specific regressions showed '
             'that cognitive decline in early relapsing-remitting multiple '
             'sclerosis was predicted by white matter integrity damage, while '
             'cognitive decline in late relapsing-remitting and progressive '

             'prone to suffer from cognitive decline. New studies now need to '
             'further elucidate the underlying mechanisms leading to cortical '

{'abstract': 'AimsTo characterize the relationship between blood pressure (BP) '
             'or heart rate and mortality and morbidity in chronic obstructive '

             'hoc analysis of baseline BP or heart rate and all-cause '
             'mortality and cardiovascular events in the SUMMIT trial. SUMMIT '
             'was a randomized double-blind outcome trial of 16485 '
             'participants (65\u2009±\u20098\u2009years, 75% male, and 47% '
             'active smokers) enrolled at 1368 sites in 43 countries. '
             'Participants with moderate COPD with or at risk for '
             'cardiovascular disease (CVD) were randomized to placebo, '
             'long-acting beta agonist, inhaled corticosteroid, or their '
             'combination. All-cause mortality increased in relation to high '
             'systolic [≥140\u2009mmHg; hazard ratio (HR) 1.27, 95% confidence '
             'interval (CI) 1.12–1.45] or diastolic (≥90\u2009mmHg; HR 1.35, '
             '95% CI 1.14–1.59) BP and low systolic (<120\u2009mmHg; HR 1.36, '
             '95% CI 1.13–1.63) or diastolic (<80\u2009mmHg; HR 1.15, 95% CI '
             '1.00–1.32) BP. Higher heart rates (≥80 per minute; HR 1.39, 95% '
             'CI 1.21–1.60) and pulse pressures (≥80\u2009mmHg; HR 1.39, 95% '
             'CI 1.07–1.80) were more linearly related to increases in '
             'all-cause mortality. The risks of cardiovascular events followed '
             'similar patterns to all-cause mortality. Similar findings were '
             'observed in subgroups of patients without established '

{'abstract': 'Stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the '
             'smooth flow of speech production. Stuttering onset occurs during '
             'a dynamic period of development when children first start '
             'learning to formulate sentences. Although most children grow out '
             'of stuttering naturally, ∼1% of all children develop persistent '
             'stuttering that can lead to significant psychosocial '
             'consequences throughout one’s life. To date, few studies have '
             'examined neural bases of stuttering in children who stutter, and '
             'even fewer have examined the basis for natural recovery versus '
             'persistence of stuttering. Here we report the first study to '
             'conduct surface-based analysis of the brain morphometric '
             'measures in children who stutter. We used FreeSurfer to extract '
             'cortical size and shape measures from structural MRI scans '
             'collected from the initial year of a longitudinal study '
             'involving 70 children (36 stuttering, 34 controls) in the '
             '3–10-year range. The stuttering group was further divided into '
             'two groups: persistent and recovered, based on their later '
             'longitudinal visits that allowed determination of their eventual '
             'clinical outcome. A region of interest analysis that focused on '
             'the left hemisphere speech network and a whole-brain exploratory '
             'analysis were conducted to examine group differences and group × '
             'age interaction effects. We found that the persistent group '
             'could be differentiated from the control and recovered groups by '
             'reduced cortical thickness in left motor and lateral premotor '
             'cortical regions. The recovered group showed an age-related '
             'decrease in local gyrification in the left medial premotor '
             'cortex (supplementary motor area and and pre-supplementary motor '
             'area). These results provide strong evidence of a primary '
             'deficit in the left hemisphere speech network, specifically '
             'involving lateral premotor cortex and primary motor cortex, in '
             'persistent developmental stuttering. Results further point to a '
             'possible compensatory mechanism involving left medial premotor '
             'cortex in those who recover from childhood stuttering.',

{'abstract': 'AimsTreatment ‘effects’ are often inferred from non-randomized '

             'non-randomized drug therapy and all-cause mortality in patients '

             'blockers, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists '
