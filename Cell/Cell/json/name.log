{'abstract': 'Hypoglycemia activates the counterregulatory response (CRR), a '
             'neural-endocrine reflex that restores euglycemia. Although '
             'effective if occasionally activated, repeated induction of the '
             'CRR leads to a decline in responsiveness and prolonged exposure '
             'to hypoglycemia. The mechanism underlying this impairment is not '
             'known. We found that the reduction in epinephrine release that '
             'characterizes a suppressed CRR involves a long-lasting form of '
             'sympatho-adrenal synaptic plasticity. Using optogenetically '
             'evoked catecholamine release, we show that recurrent '
             'hypoglycemia reduced the secretory capacity of mouse adrenal '
             'chromaffin cells. Single activation of the CRR increased the '
             'adrenal levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting '
             'enzyme for catecholamine synthesis, but this was prevented by '
             'repeated activation. In contrast, the level of neuropeptide Y '
             '(NPY), an adrenal cotransmitter, remained elevated after '
             'recurrent hypoglycemia. Inhibition of NPY or Y1 signaling, '
             'either transgenically or pharmacologically, prevented the '
             'attenuation of both TH expression and epinephrine release. These '
             'results indicate that impairment of the CRR involves suppressed '
             'activity at the adrenal level. Interfering with the peripheral '

{'abstract': 'Rationale: CMV-related morbidities remain one of the most common '
             'complications after lung transplantation and have been linked to '
             'allograft dysfunction, but the factors that predict high-risk '
             'for CMV complications and effective immunity are incompletely '
             'understood. Objectives: To determine if short telomeres in '
             'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung transplant recipients '
             '(LTRs) predict the risk for CMV-specific T-cell immunity and '
             'viral control.Methods: We studied IPF-LTRs (n=42) and '
             'age-matched non-IPF-LTRs (n=42) and assessed CMV outcomes. We '
             'measured lymphocyte telomere length (TL), DNA sequencing and '
             'assessed CMV-specific T-cell immunity in LTRs at high-risk for '
             'CMV events, using flow cytometry and flowFISH.Measurements and '
             'Main Results: We identified a high prevalence of relapsing CMV '
             'viremia in IPF-LTRs compared to non-IPF-LTRs (69% vs. 31%, Odds '
             'ratio=4.98; 95% CI: 1.95-12.50; P<0.001).Within this subset, '
             'IPF-LTRs who had short telomeres had the highest risk of CMV '
             'complications (P<0.01) including relapsing-viremia episodes, '
             'end-organ disease and CMV resistance to therapy, as well as '
             'shorter time to viremia versus age-match non-IPF controls '
             '(P<0.001). The short telomere defect in IPF-LTRs was associated '
             'with significantly impaired CMV-specific proliferative '
             'responses, T cell effector functions and induction of the major '
             'Type-1 transcription factor, T-bet.Conclusions: As the short '
             'telomere defect has been linked to the pathogenesis of IPF in '
             'some cases, our data indicate that impaired CMV immunity may be '
             'a systemic manifestation of telomere-mediated disease in these '
             'patients. Identifying this high-risk subset of lung transplant '
             'recipients has implications for risk assessment, management and '

             'immunotherapy has been hampered by lack of understanding of the '
             'molecular pathways that govern MDSC differentiation and '

             'MDSC-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity. Specifically, '
             'MDSCs in patients with melanoma and mouse melanoma exhibited '
             'increased levels of functional autophagy. Ablation of autophagy '
             'in myeloid cells markedly delayed tumor growth and endowed '
             'antitumor immune responses. Notably, tumor-infiltrating '
             'autophagy-deficient monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) demonstrated '
             'impaired suppressive activity in vitro and in vivo, whereas '
             'transcriptome analysis revealed substantial differences in genes '
             'related to lysosomal function. Accordingly, autophagy-deficient '
             'M-MDSCs exhibited impaired lysosomal degradation, thereby '
             'enhancing surface expression of MHC class II molecules, '
             'resulting in efficient activation of tumor-specific CD4+ T '
             'cells. Finally, targeting of the membrane-associated RING-CH1 '
             '(MARCH1) E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the lysosomal '
             'degradation of MHC II in M-MDSCs attenuated their suppressive '
             'function, and resulted in markedly decreased tumor volume '
             'followed by development of a robust antitumor immunity. '
             'Collectively, these findings depict autophagy as a molecular '
             'target of MDSC-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity.',

{'abstract': 'Cancer is a devastating disease. It is estimated that 1.7 '

             'developing and dying from cancer, the burdenof this disease is '
             'not equal. Substantial disparities have been present for '
             'years.Bridging these disparities defines a central challenge for '
             "our nation's cancer controlefforts.Despite a 25‐year decline in "
             'the cancer mortality rate, cancer is the second leadingcause of '
             'death in the United States and will surpass cardiovascular '
             'disease to becomethe leading cause of death in the next decade. '
             'Review of the progress to date indicatesthat, although much good '
             'has been done, much more good can be done. Since 1991, therehas '
             'been a 26% decline in the cancer death rate age adjusted to the '
             'year 2000 standardpopulation. There are more than 15.5 million '
             'cancer survivors in the United States. Given the challenge that '
             'still exists, it is appropriate to assess where the fieldsof '
             'cancer control and oncology have come from and where they are '
             'going, what issuesmust be dealt with, and what interventions '
             'must be implemented if we are to most efficientlycontrol '
             'cancer.Over the past 5 decades, there has been an extraordinary '
             'investment in cancer researchthat has led to a greater '
             'understanding of the disease. Indeed, cancer is being '
             'redefined.We are literally moving from the mid‐19th century '
             'definition based on histopathologyto a 21st century definition '
             'of cancer that also includes genomic information. '
             'Pastinvestments in basic research are yielding better diagnostic '
             'and screening technologiesand leading to new approaches to '
             'treatment. Molecular biology provides the foundationfor new '
             'treatments in precision medicine. Decades of immunology research '
             "are showingus ways to effectively harness the patient's immune "
             'system and encourage it to attacktheir cancer. At the same time, '
             'a better understanding of carcinogenesis is allowingfor improved '
             'cancer prevention.In the next several issues of , the American '
             'Cancer Society will publish a series of articles assessing '
             'trends incancer mortality and issues and opportunities in cancer '
             'prevention, screening, andtreatment. These articles summarize '
             'where we have come from, the current state ofcancer in the '

             'ofcurrently available interventions can further reduce the '
             'cancer incidence and deathrates. When there are sufficient data '
             'to make a projection, estimates of the potentialeffect of cancer '
             'control interventions are included. Of course, we must continue '
             'tosupport scientific research and innovation, as the future '
             'promises even greater benefit.The foundation of a national '
             'cancer control plan to reduce the burden of cancer isa group of '
             'initiatives to ensure equal and full access to the combination '
             'of preventiveand therapeutic measures that are already proven '
             'effective. We believe this is a moralimperative. These goals '
             'cannot be achieved, however, without recognizing that theroots '
             'of health care disparities are deep, reflecting fundamental '
             'determinants ofhealth, such as poverty, conscious and '
             'unconscious racism, barriers to the availabilityof healthy '

{'abstract': 'In both child and adult psychiatry, empirical evidence has now '
             'accrued to suggest that a single dimension is able to measure a '

             'disorders, persistence of disorders over time, and severity of '
             'symptoms. This single dimension of general psychopathology has '
             'been termed “p,” because it conceptually parallels a dimension '
             'already familiar to behavioral scientists and clinicians: the '
             '“g” factor of general intelligence. As the g dimension reflects '
             'low to high mental ability, the p dimension represents low to '
             'high psychopathology severity, with thought disorder at the '
             'extreme. The dimension of p unites all disorders. It influences '
             'present/absent status on hundreds of psychiatric symptoms, which '
             'modern nosological systems typically aggregate into dozens of '
             'distinct diagnoses, which in turn aggregate into three '
             'overarching domains, namely, the externalizing, internalizing, '
             'and psychotic experience domains, which finally aggregate into '
             'one dimension of psychopathology from low to high: p. Studies '

{'abstract': 'Cancer control is a discipline that began in the early 1900s '
             'with an emphasis on earlydetection (through prompt recognition '
             'of signs and symptoms) and surgical treatmentof disease. It '
             'became a formal scientific discipline in the 1950s with the '
             'disseminationof the Papanicolaou test and the discovery that '
             'tobacco causes lung cancer. Today,the National Cancer Institute '
             '(NCI) defines cancer control as activities to reducethe cancer '
             'burden through dissemination and delivery of evidence‐based '
             'interventions.These interventions can focus on prevention, early '
             'detection, or treatment.There are 3 measurements of population '
             'data that are commonly used to assess progressin cancer '
             'control—incidence rates, survival rates, and death rates. All 3 '
             'metricsare useful, but, as a single measure of progress, death '
             'rates are the most informative.Population‐level incidence rates '
             'are chiefly affected by levels of exposure to riskfactors and '
             'availability and use of early‐detection tests. Of note, '
             'effective screeningcan lead to increased cancer incidence rates '
             'through detection of prevalent casesor reductions in incidence '
             'when the cancer has a treatable precursor lesion. The '
             'introductionand dissemination of new diagnostic techniques such '
             'as imaging also affects incidencerates through detection of '
             'indolent cancers. Differences in screening prevalence '
             'anddetection practice over time and among population segments '
             'thus can limit the interpretationof incidence rates. Increases '
             'in survival rates, and especially 5‐year survival rates,can '
             'indicate progress, but this metric is similarly susceptible to '
             'detection‐relatedbiases and is commonly misunderstood and '
             'misused. Because the cancer mortality ordeath rate is less '
             'affected by detection practices and reflects the overall '
             'outcomeof prevention, early detection, and treatment, a downward '
             'trend in this measure isthe best indication of cancer control '
             'progress.Assessment of outcomes is impossible without '
             'high‐quality, population‐based data.These data are gathered by '
             'registrars working in treatment facilities in '

             'rates (age‐adjusted to the 2000 US standard population) for men '
             'andwomen from 1930 to 2015 are shown in Figure . The rate for '
             'men rose through most of the 20th century because of increases '
             'in tobacco‐relatedcancers, especially lung cancer. The cancer '
             'death rate for women decreased duringthe mid‐20th century '
             'because of declines in cervical, liver, colorectal, and '
             'gastriccancer. The rise in the death rate for women beginning in '
             'the mid‐1970s was becauseof increases in cigarette smoking '
             'during the period from 1940 to 1965. For both sexescombined, the '
             'death rate peaked at 215 deaths per 100,000 in 1991 and steadily '
             'declinedto 159 per 100,000 in 2015. This represents a 26% '
             'decline in cancer mortality in 24years, translating into almost '
             '2.4 million cancer deaths averted.The continuous decrease in '

             'declines in death rates for lung, colorectal, breast, and '
             'prostate cancer (Table). These 4 cancers collectively account '
             'for almost half of all cancer deaths, so theirtrends have a '
             'large influence on overall cancer mortality patterns. The death '
             'ratefor these 4 cancers combined declined 36% from 1991 to 2015, '
             'compared with a declineof 14% for all other cancers combined '
             'during the same period.The reasons for the decline in mortality '

             'diagnosed with cancer, and 1700 will die from the disease. '
             'Cancer incidence ratesincreased in children and adolescents by '
             '0.6% per year from 1975 through 2014. In contrast, death rates '

             ').The substantial progress for all of the major childhood '
             'cancers is because of improvementsin treatment and has been '
             'facilitated by high levels of participation in clinicaltrials. '
             'Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of survivors of '
             'childhood cancer growinto adulthood with comorbidities '
             'associated with the disease or its treatment. It is estimated '
             'that most pediatric cancer survivors have at least 5 comorbid '
             'conditionsand that long‐term survivors of childhood or '
             'adolescent cancers are 8 times more likelyto have a serious '
             'chronic health condition than siblings who had not been '
             'diagnosedwith cancer. Common side effects from therapy include: '
             'growth retardation, cognitive impairment,cardiopulmonary '
             'difficulties, impairment of sexual function, infertility, '
             'posttraumaticstress disorder, and secondary cancers. Current '
             'pediatric research is aimed at improvingthe treatments, making '
             'them more efficacious, and decreasing the temporary and '
             'permanentside effects of therapy. Although the significant '
             'success in pediatric cancer hasspurred the discipline of “cancer '
             'survivorship,” there is still much work to do.There are '
             'differences in cancer mortality among populations categorized by '
             'race/ethnicity,economic and educational level, or region of '
             'residence. Many disparities are due largelyto a failure to get '
             'adequate medical care to Americans who need it. This includes '
             'preventive care, such as education and other interventions to '
             'promoteadoption of a healthy lifestyle (ie, eating a healthy '
             'diet, exercising, and not smoking),as well as vaccinations and '
             'cancer screening.In 1971, President Richard Nixon signed the '
             'National Cancer Act. This law createdthe National Cancer Program '
             'and began what many refer to as the War on Cancer. Itfunded the '
             'programs that collected much of the cancer epidemiologic and end '
             'resultsdata used in this paper. It also catalyzed a tremendous '
             'research effort to learn aboutcancer and how to control it. A '
             'substantial proportion of the decline in cancer mortalityover '
             'the past 3 decades would not have occurred without the knowledge '
             'gained fromthe National Cancer Program. However, the data '
             'presented herein clearly demonstrateone vital fact: We can do '
             'better. Many more cancer deaths could be prevented throughwider '
             'adoption of known cancer preventive behaviors and interventions '
             'and broaderaccess to high‐quality cancer care. There are vast '
             'opportunities to reduce the cancerburden today, in the absence '
             'of new technologies or treatment, by expanding deliveryof '
             'currently established evidence‐based care to all Americans.',

{'abstract': 'This article was published at Annals.org on 19 June '
             '2018.Background: In 2015, firearms were involved in more than '
             '250000 nonfatal victimizations in the United States (1). '
             'Physicians are familiar with the physical consequences of '
             'firearm violence (2), but less is known about the '
             'firearm-specific mental health consequences. The perceived level '
             "of threat to a person's life during a traumatic event may "
             'influence his or her mental health response (3). Because '
             'firearms are highly lethal weapons, their presence may '
             'exacerbate the mental health effects of violent '
             'victimization.Objective: To assess the association between '
             'firearm involvement during a violent victimization and the '
             'prevalence of severe distress and social functioning problems '
             'attributed to the victimization.Methods and Findings: We used '
             'cross-sectional data from the National Crime Victimization '
             'Survey, a nationally representative sample of households (4). '
             'Respondents aged 12 years or older who experienced a personal '
             'violent victimization (that is, an attack; a threat of attack; '
             'or attempted harm, including unwanted sexual contact) in the 6 '
             'months before the interview were eligible for inclusion in the '
             'study (n= 8465). We included the first reported victimization '
             'for respondents interviewed between 2008 and 2015 (18% of '
             'respondents reported more than 1 victimization). When the first '
             'incident could not be distinguished, respondents were excluded '
             'from the sample (7% [n= 581]).The presence of a weapon was '
             'self-reported. Firearm victimizations (n= 715), the exposure of '
             'interest, were compared with those involving another weapon (n= '
             '1054) and no weapon (n= 5350). Other weapons included rocks, '
             'knives, and axes. In 765 cases, the presence or type of weapon '
             'could not be determined; these were excluded from the study '
             'sample.Two outcome measures were used to identify mental health '
             'consequences. Respondents reported whether being a crime victim '
             'was distressing (responses ranged from not at all to severely). '
             'Severe distress was compared with all other levels of distress. '
             'Respondents also reported whether the victimization led to '
             'substantial problems in their social life, including their job, '
             'schoolwork, and interactions with family or friends.We '
             'calculated the prevalence of reported social functioning '
             'problems and severe distress among persons whose victimizations '
             'involved a firearm, another weapon, and no weapon and compared '
             'these proportions. We used survey weights and adjusted SEs to '
             'account for the complex survey design and reweighting to adjust '
             'for outcome missingness. Analyses were conducted using the svy '
             'commands in Stata, version 14.2 (StataCorp).Among all '
             'respondents in the sample, 26% reported severe distress as a '
             'result of the victimization and 27% reported having problems at '
             'work or school or with friends or family after the incident. '
             'Table 1 shows respondent characteristics by victimization '
             'type.Those whose violent victimizations involved firearms were '
             'more likely to report severe distress than those whose '
             'victimizations involved other weapons (prevalence ratio, 1.27 '
             '[95% CI, 1.06 to 1.51]) or did not involve weapons (prevalence '
             'ratio, 1.63 [CI, 1.38 to 1.93]) (Table 2). Differences in the '
             'prevalence of reported social functioning problems were not '
             'statistically significant. The findings remained consistent in '
             'models adjusted for the variables in Table 1 (data not '
             'shown).Discussion: Our findings suggest that firearm '
             'victimization is associated with increased levels of distress, '
             'greater than the effects of the victimization itself. These '
             'findings may be explained by the fear of death being increased '
             'in situations involving more lethal weapons (3). However, the '
             "presence of a firearm did not seem to affect respondents' social "
             'functioning, perhaps because we used the first reported violent '
             'victimization. Cumulative exposures have documented associations '
             'with substantial mental health risk (5).We present novel '
             'findings for a general population experiencing violent '
             'victimization. However, this study has some limitations. These '
             'include a cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported '
             'measures of weapon exposure during the victimization and of '
             'mental health, which were sometimes not reported. In addition, '
             'we cannot determine whether responses to the mental health '
             'questions applied to the time of the event or a time during the '
             '6 months after the event.These findings suggest that firearm '
             'violence has unique negative effects on mental health in '
             'addition to well-understood effects on physical health and that '
             'patients victimized with a firearm may require special '
             'attention. They also highlight the emotional costs that might be '
             'avoided by investing in efforts to prevent firearm violence.In '

{'abstract': 'Sarcoidosis is believed to be caused by both genetic and '

             'remains unknown. We aimed to estimate the familial aggregation '
             'and heritability of sarcoidosis using a case-control-family '
             'study design and population-based Swedish registers.We '
             'identified 23\u200a880 individuals with visits for sarcoidosis '

             'ascertained for sarcoidosis in the Patient Register. We '

             "≥2 relatives (RR 4.7) and in Löfgren's syndrome (RR 4.1). The "
             'heritability was 39% (95% CI 12−65).This large investigation '
             'showed that having a relative with sarcoidosis is a very strong '

             'high-income countries. In the past decade, rates of pertussis '
             'disease have increased in children receiving only aP vaccines. '
             'We compared the immune responses to aP boosters in individuals '
             'who received their initial doses with either wP or aP vaccines '
             'using activation-induced marker (AIM) assays. Specifically, we '
             'examined pertussis-specific memory CD4+ T cell responses ex '
             'vivo, highlighting a type 2/Th2 versus type 1/Th1 and Th17 '
             'differential polarization as a function of childhood '
             'vaccination. Remarkably, after a contemporary aP booster, cells '
             'from donors originally primed with aP were (a) associated with '
             'increased IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-9, and TGF-β and decreased IFN-γ '
             'and IL-17 production, (b) defective in their ex vivo capacity to '
             'expand memory cells, and (c) less capable of proliferating in '

             'equivalent increases of antibody titers and plasmablasts after '
             'aP boost were seen in both groups. In conclusion, our data '
             'suggest that there are long-lasting effects and differences in '
             'polarization and proliferation of T cell responses in adults '

             '(cases) and 92 individuals without CRC (controls) in Hong Kong '

             'alignment against an integrated microbial reference genome '
             'database. Viral markers associated with CRC were validated using '
             'fecal samples from 3 separate cohorts: 111 patients with CRC and '
             '112 controls in Hong Kong, 46 patients with CRC and 63 controls '
             'in Austria, and 91 patients with CRC and 66 controls in France '
             'and Germany. Using abundance profiles ofCRC-associated virome '
             'genera, we constructed random survival forest models to identify '
             'those associated with patient survival times.ResultsThe '
             'diversity of the gut bacteriophage community was significantly '
             'increased in patients with CRC compared with controls. '
             'Twenty-two viral taxa discriminated cases from controls with an '
             'area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.802 '
             'in the discovery cohort. The viral markers were validated in 3 '
             'cohorts, with area under the receiver operating characteristic '
             'curves of 0.763, 0.736, and 0.715, respectively. Clinical '
             'subgroup analysis showed that dysbiosis of the gut virome was '
             'associated with early- and late-stage CRC. A combination of 4 '
             'taxonomic markers associated with reduced survival of patients '
             'with CRC (log-rank test, P= 8.1× 10–6) independently of tumor '

{'abstract': 'The Lancet Asthma Commission highlighted that non-adherence '
             'remains a persistent barrier within asthma care. Medical '
             'consultations remain pivotal in addressing non-adherence, but '
             'interest in additional adherence support from pharmacists is '
             'increasing. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to '
             'evaluate how effective pharmacist-led interventions are in '
             'improving medication adherence in adults with asthma.Studies '
             'were included if they had adult participants with asthma, '
             'pharmacist-led or collaborative care interventions, randomised '
             'controlled trial (RCT) designs comparing interventions with '
             'usual pharmacist care, and a medication adherence outcome. We '
             'analysed adherence data using the standardised mean difference ( '
             'd ) and the remaining data was synthesized narratively.From 1159 '
             'records, 11 were included in the narrative synthesis and nine in '
             'the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis for adherence produced a '
             'medium effect size of d =0.49 (SE=0.08, 95% CI 0.35–0.64, '
             'p<0.0001) with low statistical heterogeneity.In line with the '
             'Perceptions and Practicalities Approach (PAPA), interventions '
             'targeted to address both the perceptions and practicalities that '
             'influence individual motivation and ability to adhere were more '
             'effective. Contextual factors (country and healthcare setting) '
             'were also influential. Our findings suggest that with adequate '

{'abstract': 'Joint bleeds are common in congenital hemophilia, but rare in '

             'mechanisms responsible for joint-specific bleeding in congenital '
             'hemophilia, bleeding phenotypes after joint injury and tail '
             'transection were compared in aHA wild-type mice (receiving an '
             'anti-FVIII antibody), and congenital hemophilia A (FVIII-/-) '
             'mice. Both aHA and FVIII-/- mice bled severely after tail '
             'transection, but consistent with clinical findings, joint '
             'bleeding was notably milder in aHA compared to FVIII-/- mice. '
             'Focus was directed to Thrombin-Activatable Fibrinolysis '
             'Inhibitor (TAFI) to determine its potentially protective effect '
             'on joint bleeding in aHA. Joint bleeding in TAFI-/- mice with '
             'anti-FVIII antibody was increased, compared to wild-type aHA '
             'mice, and became indistinguishable from joint bleeding in '
             'FVIII-/- mice. Measurements of circulating TAFI zymogen '
             'consumption after joint injury indicated severely defective TAFI '
             'activation in FVIII-/- mice in vivo, consistent with previous in '
             'vitro analysis in FVIII-deficient plasma. In contrast, notable '
             'TAFI activation was observed in aHA mice, suggesting that TAFI '
             'protected aHA joints against bleeding. Pharmacological '
             'inhibitors of fibrinolysis revealed that urokinase Plasminogen '
             'Activator (uPA)-induced fibrinolysis drove joint bleeding, '
             'whereas tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA)-mediated '

             'TAFI as an important modifier of hemophilic joint bleeding in '
             'aHA by inhibiting uPA-mediated fibrinolysis. Moreover, our data '
             'suggest that bleed protection by TAFI was absent in congenital '
             'FVIII-/- mice due to severely defective TAFI activation, '

             'clinical gastroenterology. It is estimated that approximately '
             '10% to 15% of the general adult population is affected. Using '
             'the GRADE framework, this guideline offers 9 recommendations '
             'about pharmacological therapy for IBS-C and IBS-D. For this '
             'review, the important role of nonpharmacological therapies, '
             'including dietary and lifestyle modification, was not '
             'considered.Despite the large number of published studies, in '
             'most cases our recommendations are weak because either (1) the '
             'quality of the available data and/or (2) the balance of risks '
             'and benefits for a particular therapy do not overwhelmingly '
             'support its use. In one case, alosetron for IBS-D, our '
             'recommendation is conditional, reflecting additional limitations '
             'based on FDA requirements. Given the growing focus on the need '
             'to show the comparative effectiveness of therapeutic '
             'alternatives, it is important to note that essentially no '
             'studies exist in this area comparing commonly used therapies '
             'with each other. Further, there are no substantial data '
             'comparing combinations of various therapies with placebo or with '
             'each other. Because no IBS therapy is uniformly effective, many '
             'patients describe a history of a variety of treatments alone or '
             'in combination. The present guideline is unable to address this '

             'Antibiotics Be Routinely Used in Patients With Acute '
             'Uncomplicated Diverticulitis?The AGA suggests that antibiotics '

             'with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. (Conditional '
             'recommendation, low quality of evidence).Until recently, '
             'antibiotics have been the unquestioned cornerstone of treatment '
             'of patients with acute diverticulitis, consistently recommended '
             'in prior guidelines, textbooks, and expert reviews. The emerging '
             'belief that acute diverticulitis may be more inflammatory than '
             'infectious, as well as increasing concerns about the overuse of '
             'antibiotics have led to preliminary investigations into the '
             'necessity of antibiotics. Two recent randomized trials and 2 '
             'systematic reviews have reported no clear benefit and questioned '
             'the routine use of antibiotics, as does this guideline, '
             'suggesting selective and individualized use. It is important to '
             'emphasize that the current data are of low quality, and '
             'recommendations could change as further studies are performed. '
             'Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated '
             'disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the '
             'results should not be generalized to complicated patients (ie, '
             'those with abscesses or fistulas), those with signs of severe '
             'infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with '
             'other significant comorbidities. This recommendation is '
             'conditional due to the low quality of current evidence. '
             'Additionally, outpatient management without antibiotics has not '
             'been studied, although we would expect these patients to have '
             'generally milder disease and logically equal or better '
             'outcomes.Jump to SectionRecommendationsQuestion 1. Should '

             'Colonoscopy Be Performed After an Episode of Acute '
             'Diverticulitis Confirmed by CT Scan?The AGA suggests that '
             'colonoscopy be performed after resolution of acute '
             'diverticulitis in appropriate candidates to exclude the '
             'misdiagnosis of a colonic neoplasm if a high-quality examination '
             'of the colon has not been recently performed. (Conditional '
             'recommendation, low quality of evidence).Observational studies '
             'of cohorts of patients with imaging-proven diverticulitis who '
             'subsequently underwent colonoscopy detected a small number of '
             'colorectal cancers (15 cases/1000 patients) and advanced '
             'adenomas (38 cases/1000 patients). Absence of a mass lesion on '
             'CT scan does not exclude the possibility of an underlying '
             'colonic neoplasm. Evidence of alternative, non-neoplastic '
             'explanations for the index presentation, such as inflammatory '
             'bowel disease or ischemic colitis, was either infrequently '
             'identified or not reported in the systematic review. Although an '
             'increased risk of recurrent diverticulitis or colonic '
             'perforation is a concern in patients undergoing colonoscopy '
             'after an episode of acute diverticulitis, this was not reported '
             'as an adverse event in the available literature. Although not '
             'directly addressed in the existing studies, factors that may '
             'influence a decision to perform a colonoscopy after an episode '
             'of acute diverticulitis include (1) timing and completeness of a '
             'prior colonoscopy, (2) comorbidities, (3) persistent symptoms of '
             'abdominal pain or diarrhea, and (4) patient preferences. The '
             'risks of colonoscopy may be higher in patients with chronic '
             'diverticulitis, acute recurrent diverticulitis, or complicated '
             'diverticulitis. The optimal timing of colonoscopy after an '
             'episode of acute diverticulitis is uncertain, but the severity '
             'and duration of the episode are relevant considerations. '
             'Intervals of 6 to 8 weeks after resolution of acute '
             'diverticulitis are commonly followed.Jump to '

             'Colonic Resection Be Performed After an Initial Episode of Acute '
             'Uncomplicated Diverticulitis?The AGA suggests against elective '
             'colonic resection in patients with an initial episode of acute '
             'uncomplicated diverticulitis. The decision to perform elective '
             'prophylactic colonic resection in this setting should be '
             'individualized. (Conditional recommendation, very-low quality of '
             'evidence).Approximately 20% of patients with acute uncomplicated '
             'diverticulitis experience a recurrent episode of diverticulitis '
             'in the following 5 years. The risk of future diverticular '
             'complications and need for emergency surgery among patients '
             'treated medically without colonic resection is low (<5%). From a '
             'patient perspective, the potential need for a colostomy for '
             'recurrent diverticulitis is of particular concern. Importantly, '
             'approximately 10% of patients managed with elective sigmoid '
             'resection after an episode of acute diverticulitis experience '
             'short-term complications of surgery, including wound infection, '
             'anastomotic leak, and cardiovascular/thrombotic events. Such '
             'postoperative risks are increased in patients older than 65years '
             'of age. Long-term complications of abdominal distention, '
             'cramping, altered defecation, and fecal incontinence are '
             'reported in 25% of patients after elective surgery. A reduction '
             'in risk of recurrent diverticulitis after elective surgery may '
             'exist, but the magnitude of this benefit is difficult to '
             'ascertain based on limited data. The rates of recurrent '
             'diverticulitis appear to be higher in younger patients and the '
             'operative risks are lower, but the data do not support elective '
             'surgery in this subgroup when presenting with acute '
             'uncomplicated diverticulitis. Similarly, recent retrospective '
             'data have challenged existing recommendations for elective '
             'surgery in patients with repeated episodes of acute '

             'acute diverticulitis has undergone meaningful changes over the '
             'past decade, including more judicious use of antibiotics and '
             'surgery as well as preliminary and ongoing investigations into '
             'medical therapies to decrease symptoms and reduce recurrence. '
             'However, the majority of the evidence is currently of poor '
             'quality, and most of our recommendations are therefore '
             'conditional. Areas that should be priorities for future research '
             'include the following:•Identifying patients who will benefit '
             'from antibiotics and those in whom it can safely be '
             'withheld.•Evaluating medical therapies, such as '
             'anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, or probiotics, and dietary '
             'interventions that may decrease symptoms and complications '
             'and/or reduce recurrence rates after an episode of acute '
             'diverticulitis.•Identifying risk factors for recurrent '
             'diverticulitis to better target potential medical interventions '
             'to populations most likely to benefit.•Quantifying the yield, '

{'abstract': 'The introduction of a whole-cell vaccine against Bordetella '
             'pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, dramatically '
             'reduced disease incidence. Unfortunately, the whole-cell '
             'formulation also induces severe reactions in some infants. '
             'Because of this, acellular vaccines have been developed, but '
             'they are used exclusively in high-income countries. However, the '
             'acellular vaccines do not provide long-term protection, and '
             'despite the use of routine boosters, the disease is on the rise. '
             'In this issue of the JCI, da Silva Antunes and colleagues '
             'demonstrate that the whole-cell vaccines promote long-term '
             'polarization toward Th1 and Th17 responses, while the acellular '
             'vaccines induce Th2 polarization. Moreover, this polarization is '
             'long term, as the response to acellular boosters is dependent on '
             'the initial vaccine given in infancy. The authors speculate that '
             'Tregs may be induced by initial acellular vaccine '

{'abstract': 'Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and is the '
             'second leading causeof death in the United States. In this '
             'article, we provide the expected numbers ofnew cancer cases and '
             'deaths in 2017 in the United States nationally and for each '
             'state,as well as a comprehensive overview of cancer incidence, '
             'mortality, and survival ratesand trends using population‐based '
             'data. The most current cancer data are availablethrough 2013 for '
             'incidence and through 2014 for mortality. We also estimate the '
             'totalnumber of deaths averted as a result of the continual '
             'decline in cancer death ratessince the early 1990s. In addition, '
             'we present the actual number of deaths reportedin 2014 by age '
             'for the 10 leading causes of death and for the 5 leading causes '
             'ofcancer death.Although the estimated numbers of new cancer '
             'cases and deaths expected to occur in2017 provide a reasonably '
             'accurate portrayal of the contemporary cancer burden, theyare '
             'model‐based, 3‐year‐ or 4‐year‐ahead projections that should be '
             'interpreted withcaution and not be used to track trends over '
             'time. First, the estimates may be affectedby changes in '
             'methodology as we take advantage of improvements in modeling '
             'techniquesand cancer surveillance coverage. Second, although the '
             'model is robust, it can onlyaccount for trends through the most '
             'recent year of data (currently 2013 for incidenceand 2014 for '
             'mortality) and cannot anticipate abrupt fluctuations for cancers '
             'affectedby changes in detection practice, such as prostate '
             'cancer. Third, the model can beoversensitive to sudden or large '
             'changes in observed data. The most informative metricsfor '
             'tracking cancer trends are age‐standardized or age‐specific '
             'cancer death ratesfrom the NCHS and cancer incidence rates from '
             'SEER, NPCR, and/or NAACCR.Errors in reporting race/ethnicity in '
             'medical records and on death certificates mayresult in '
             'underestimates of cancer incidence and mortality rates in '
             'nonwhite and nonblackpopulations. This is particularly relevant '
             'for AI/AN populations. It is also importantto note that cancer '
             'data in the United States are primarily reported for broad, '
             'heterogeneousracial and ethnic groups, masking substantial and '
             'important differences in the cancerburden within these '
             'subpopulations. For example, among API men, lung cancer '
             'incidencerates in Hawaiian men are just as high as those in '
             'non‐Hispanic white men and 3‐foldhigher than those in Asian '
             'Indian/Pakistani men based on limited data available '
             'bypopulation subgroups. Thus, the high burden of lung and other '
             'cancers among Hawaiiansis completely concealed with the '
             'presentation of aggregated API data.The continuous decline in '
             'cancer death rates over 2 decades has resulted in an overalldrop '
             'of 25%, resulting in 2.1 million fewer cancer deaths during this '
             'time period.Moreover, racial disparities in cancer death rates '
             'are continuing to decline and theproportion of blacks who are '
             'uninsured has halved since 2010, potentially expeditingfurther '
             'progress. Despite these successes, death rates are increasing '
             'rapidly forcancers of the liver (one of the most fatal cancers) '
             'and uterine corpus, both of whichare strongly associated with '
             'obesity. Advancing the fight against cancer requirescontinued '
             'clinical and basic research to improve detection practices, as '
             'well as treatment.In addition, creative new strategies are also '
             'needed to increase healthy behaviorsnationwide and to more '
             'broadly apply existing cancer control knowledge across '

{'abstract': 'Hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin has been implicated in the '
             'pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and accumulating '
             'clinical evidence indicates a potential link between orexin and '
             'depression. However, the exact role of orexin in depression, '
             'particularly the underlying neural substrates and mechanisms, '
             'remains unknown. In this study, we reveal a direct projection '
             'from the hypothalamic orexinergic neurons to the ventral '
             'pallidum (VP), a structure that receives an increasing attention '
             'for its critical position in rewarding processing, stress '
             'responses, and depression. We find that orexin directly excites '
             'GABAergic VP neurons and prevents depressive-like behaviors in '
             'rats. Two orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R, and their downstream '
             'Na+–Ca2+ exchanger and L-type Ca2+ channel co-mediate the effect '
             'of orexin. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade or genetic '
             'knockdown of orexin receptors in VP increases depressive-like '
             'behaviors in forced swim test and sucrose preference test. '
             'Intriguingly, blockage of orexinergic inputs in VP has no impact '
             'on social proximity in social interaction test between novel '
             'partners, but remarkably strengthens social avoidance under an '
             'acute psychosocial stress triggered by social rank. Notably, a '
             'significantly increased orexin level in VP is accompanied by an '
             'increase in serum corticosterone in animals exposed to acute '
             'stresses, including forced swimming, food/water deprivation and '
             'social rank stress, rather than non-stress situations. These '
             'results suggest that endogenous orexinergic modulation on VP is '
             'especially critical for protecting against depressive reactions '
             'to stressful events. The findings define an indispensable role '
             'for the central orexinergic system in preventing depression by '

             'genome-wide significance, the cross-disorder phenotype showed '
             'strong positive genetic correlations with other psychiatric '

             'that although AN and OCD overlap heavily in their shared risk '

             'AN/OCD was associated with particular tissue or cell-type gene '

{'abstract': 'Understanding how tumor cells fundamentally alter their identity '
             'is critical to identify specific vulnerabilities for use in '
             'precision medicine. In B cell malignancy, knowledge of genetic '
             'changes has resulted in great gains in our understanding of the '
             'biology of tumor cells, impacting diagnosis, prognosis and '
             'treatment. Despite this knowledge, much remains to be explained '
             'as genetic events do not completely explain clinical behavior '
             'and outcomes. Many patients lack recurrent driver mutations, and '
             'said drivers can persist in non-malignant cells of healthy '
             'individuals remaining cancer-free for decades. Epigenetics has '
             'emerged as a valuable avenue to further explain tumor '
             'phenotypes. The epigenetic landscape is the software that powers '
             'and stabilizes cellular identity by abridging a broad genome '
             'into the essential information required per cell. A genome-level '
             'view of B cell malignancies reveals complex but recurrent '
             'epigenetic patterns that define tumor types and subtypes, '
             'permitting high-resolution classification and novel insight into '
             'tumor-specific mechanisms. Epigenetic alterations are guided by '
             'distinct cellular processes, such as polycomb-based silencing, '
             'transcription, signaling pathways and transcription factor (TF) '
             'activity, and involve B cell-specific aspects, such as AIDCA '
             'activity and germinal center-specific events. Armed with a '
             'detailed knowledge of the epigenetic events that occur across '
             'the spectrum of B cell differentiation, B cell tumor-specific '
             'aberrations can be detected with improved accuracy, and serves '
             'as a model for identification of tumor-specific events in '
             'cancer. Insight gained through recent efforts may prove valuable '

{'abstract': 'Background & AimsNon-celiac gluten sensitivity is characterized '
             'by symptom improvement after gluten withdrawal in absence of '
             'celiac disease. The mechanisms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity '
             'are unclear, and there are no biomarkers for this disorder. '
             'Foods with gluten often contain fructans, a type of fermentable '
             'oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols. We aimed to '
             'investigate the effect of gluten and fructans separately in '
             'individuals with self-reported gluten sensitivity.MethodsWe '
             'performed a double-blind crossover challenge of 59 individuals '
             'on a self-instituted gluten-free diet, for whom celiac disease '
             'had been excluded. The study was performed at Oslo University '
             'Hospital in Norway from October 2014 through May 2016. '
             'Participants were randomly assigned to groups placed on diets '
             'containing gluten (5.7 g), fructans (2.1 g), or placebo, '
             'concealed in muesli bars, for 7 days. Following a minimum 7-day '
             'washout period (until the symptoms induced by the previous '
             'challenge were resolved), participants crossed over into a '
             'different group, until they completed all 3 challenges (gluten, '
             'fructan, and placebo). Symptoms were measured by '
             'Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale Irritable Bowel Syndrome '
             '(GSRS-IBS) version. A linear mixed model for analysis was '
             'used.ResultsOverall GSRS-IBS scores differed significantly '
             'during gluten, fructan, and placebo challenges; mean values were '
             '33.1 ± 13.3, 38.6±12.3, and 34.3 ± 13.9, respectively (P= .04). '
             'Mean scores for GSRS-IBS bloating were 9.3 ± 3.5, 11.6 ± 3.5, '
             'and 10.1 ± 3.7, respectively, during the gluten, fructan, and '
             'placebo challenges (P= .004). The overall GSRS-IBS score for '
             'participants consuming fructans was significantly higher than '
             'for participants consuming gluten (P= .049), as was the GSRS '
             'bloating score (P= .003). Thirteen participants had the highest '
             'overall GSRS-IBS score after consuming gluten, 24 had the '

{'abstract': 'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection constitutes a global public '
             'health problem. In order to establish how HBV was disseminated '
             'across different geographic regions, we estimated the levels of '

{'abstract': 'Background Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the gold standard '
             'treatment for operable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary '
             'hypertension (CTEPH). However, a proportion of patients with '
             'operable disease decline surgery. There are currently no '
             'published data on this patient group. The aim of this study was '
             'to identify outcomes and prognostic factors in a large cohort of '
             'consecutive patients with CTEPH.Methods Data were collected for '
             'consecutive, treatment-naïve CTEPH patients between 2001–2014 '
             'identified from the ASPIRE registry.Results Of 550 CTEPH '
             'patients (age 63±15years, follow-up 4±3years), 49 percent '
             'underwent surgery, 32% had technically operable disease and did '
             'not undergo surgery (including patient choice n=72, unfit for '
             'surgery n=63) and 19% had inoperable disease due to disease '
             'distribution. Five-year-survival was superior in patients '
             'undergoing PEA (83%) versus technically operable disease who did '
             'not undergo surgery (53%) and inoperable due to disease '
             'distribution (59%), p<0.001. Survival was superior in patients '
             'following PEA compared to those offered but declining surgery '
             '(55%), p<0.001. In patients offered PEA, independent prognostic '
             'factors included mixed venous oxygen saturation, gas transfer '
             'and patient decision to proceed to surgery.Conclusions Outcomes '
             'in CTEPH following PEA are excellent and superior to patients '
             'declining surgery and strongly favour consideration of a '

{'abstract': 'PurposeIntroduction of new immune therapies that may have a '
             'delayed beneficial effect necessitates re-evaluation of '
             'traditional clinical trial designs in oncology. A key design '
             'feature of randomized trials is interim futility monitoring, '
             'which allows stopping early if the accruing data convincingly '
             'demonstrate that the experimental treatment is detrimental or is '
             'unlikely to be shown superior to the standard treatment. The '
             'appropriateness of futility monitoring is frequently questioned '
             'when the effect of the experimental treatment may be delayed '
             '(eg, in trials of many immune agents). We examine the '
             'advisability of using futility monitoring when there is '
             'potential for a delayed treatment effect and make '
             'recommendations concerning its use.MethodsWe evaluated the loss '
             'of statistical power when using some common futility interim '
             'monitoring rules and a new proposed conservative rule via '
             'simulation under varying amounts of treatment-effect delay and '
             'varying accrual periods. We also considered scenarios where the '
             'experimental treatment starts out being worse than the standard '
             'treatment but ends up being better, as may sometimes be the case '
             'when an immune therapy is compared with an active standard '
             'therapy.ResultsSome standard methods of futility monitoring can '
             'result in an unacceptable loss of power when there is a delayed '
             'treatment effect, especially if the accrual period is rapid or '
             'the experimental treatment is initially worse. The proposed '
             'conservative futility rule has a negligible loss of power in the '
             'situations considered.ConclusionAlthough care must be taken with '
             'the choice of futility monitoring when there is a delayed '
             'treatment effect, inclusion of appropriate rules can reduce the '
             'exposure of patients to ineffective therapies without reducing '
             'the probability of correctly identifying effective treatments.',

             'conceptual aspects that are coherent with our current '
             'understanding of how liver disease progresses. Firstly, '
             'structural changes as evidenced by changes in organ volume (i.e. '
             'spleen and liver) and compositional change (i.e. increased liver '
             'T1 and splenic T1) relate to increasing disease progression from '
             'the spectrum of HVs to DC. Secondly, changes in haemodynamics, '
             'both to and within the organ, evolve with progressive disease. '
             'This is exemplified by the reduction in both liver and splenic '
             'perfusion. Despite the small size of the DC group, it is '
             'interesting to note that the reduction of hepatic perfusion '
             'occurs in the context of increased total hepatic blood delivery '
             'in the CC and DC group, though this only results in an increase '
             'in normalised hepatic blood flow between the HV and DC group '
             '(Fig. S5Fig. S5). The reduction in liver volume that occurs in '
             'DC compared to CC patients, as previously shown in,24x[24]Tong, '

             'ReferencesThis study was designed as a proof of concept study to '
             'assess the feasibility of using MRI to assess different organs '
             'in cirrhosis and confirms this is possible. Importantly, the '
             'scan time for the present protocol is one hour. Whilst we have '
             'obviated the requirement for an intravenous contrast agent, the '
             'scan time can now be reduced by omitting parameters which have '
             'been found to be non-contributory. This will be important for '
             'patient compliance and reducing cost and burden on radiology '
             'service provision time for future implementation into clinical '
             'practice. Whilst the MR picture obtained provides an overview it '
             'is by no means an exclusive assessment of the hyperdynamic '
             'circulation. For example, the current protocol does not provide '
             'an assessment of systemic vascular resistance nor does it '
             'delineate intrahepatic shunts, which we have postulated to '
             'underpin the marked reduction in liver perfusion. We '
             'deliberately chose aspects of MRI measurements that have been '
             'validated previously by our group and others based on comparison '
             'to gold standard reference tests including invasive angiography '
             'and liver biopsy. The current imaging protocol has been '
             'performed on 1.5\u202fT but can easily be applied at 3\u202fT, '
             'which provides higher signal-to-noise ratio and spatial '
             'resolution. Demonstrating that monitoring of therapy with MRI '

             'be required before considering implementation into clinical '

{'abstract': 'BACKGROUND. The circadian clock is a fundamental and pervasive '
             'biological program that coordinates 24-hour rhythms in '
             'physiology, metabolism, and behavior, and it is essential to '
             'health. Whereas therapy adapted to time of day is increasingly '
             'reported to be highly successful, it needs to be personalized, '
             'since internal circadian time is different for each individual. '
             'In addition, internal time is not a stable trait, but is '
             'influenced by many factors, including genetic predisposition, '
             'age, sex, environmental light levels, and season. An easy and '
             'convenient diagnostic tool is currently missing.METHODS. To '
             'establish a validated test, we followed a 3-stage biomarker '
             'development strategy: (a) using circadian transcriptomics of '
             'blood monocytes from 12 individuals in a constant routine '
             'protocol combined with machine learning approaches, we '
             'identified biomarkers for internal time; and these biomarkers '
             '(b) were migrated to a clinically relevant gene expression '
             'profiling platform (NanoString) and (c) were externally '
             'validated using an independent study with 28 early or late '
             'chronotypes.RESULTS. We developed a highly accurate and simple '
             'assay (BodyTime) to estimate the internal circadian time in '
             'humans from a single blood sample. Our assay needs only a small '
             'set of blood-based transcript biomarkers and is as accurate as '
             'the current gold standard method, dim-light melatonin onset, at '
             'smaller monetary, time, and sample-number cost.CONCLUSION. The '

             'serious methodologic and clinical concerns about the validity of '

             'the authors amend their Discussion and Conclusions to '
             'acknowledge these deficiencies.We have several methodologic '
             'concerns. First, the authors conclude that LNF has the greatest '
             'ability to improve physiologic parameters of GERD compared with '
             'TIF or PPI. This conclusion is based on rankings and '
             'probabilities (ie, the surface under the cumulative ranking '
             'curve [SUCRA]). This conclusion is premature and ignores the '
             'basic principles of evaluating certainty in estimates of network '
             'meta-analysis. Since the early days of network meta-analysis, '
             'methodologists and statisticians have recognized that crude '
             'rankings can be misleading and ignore the domains of certainty '
             'in evidence. Instead of rankings, we should look at the pairwise '
             'relative association measures and apply the GRADE approach. '
             'Indeed, an empirical evaluation showed that the SUCRA estimates '
             'have extremely wide 95% credible intervals (median width of 65%) '
             'and that most of the time there is no significant difference '
             'between the best-ranked intervention and the second or third '
             'best-ranked interventions (shown in 90% and 71% of comparisons, '
             'respectively).2x2Brignardello-Petersen, R. et al. JClin '

             'all References we observe this challenge. First of all, the '
             'SUCRA results show that LNF is superior compared with TIF in '
             'increasing lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. However, '
             'when looking at the odds ratio (0.65 [95% credible interval, '
             '0.10–4.09]), we see that it ranges from a 90% reduction in the '
             'odds ratio up to a 400% increase in the opposite direction. '
             'Following GRADE (and intuitively), this evidence warrants very '
             'low certainty and according to the definition of certainty in '
             'evidence, and this means that future research will likely show '
             'different findings. The uncertainty regarding the pooled odds '
             'ratio extends to the study’s two other outcomes; persistent '
             'esophagitis and improvement in health-related quality of life '
             '(HRQOL). The only outcome that was associated with a '
             'statistically significant difference (percent of time pH < 4) '
             'was associated with a too extreme (and hard to believe) odds '
             'ratio of 0.08 and a prohibitively high degree of heterogeneity '
             '(I2= 88.3%), which is neither described or adjusted for by '
             'sensitivity analysis, nor acknowledged in the discussion.The '
             'authors also claim that TIF superiority trend in improving HRQOL '
             'is confounded by the short duration of follow-up, yet they '
             'failed to include the 3-year follow-up study results from the '
             'TIF TEMPO randomized trial accepted September 13, 2016, within '
             'the period of their search that extended to May 10, 2017. '
             'Finally, metaregression is not a tool to adjust or detect '
             'confounding when the included interventions vary in the length '
             'of follow-up; you cannot adjust for data you do not have.The '
             'heterogeneity in the study populations increases our concern '
             'about this analysis. The authors included studies evaluating '
             'different groups of patients with varying baseline '
             'characteristics, such as previous responsiveness to PPI therapy, '
             'esophagitis grade, and hiatal hernia. Furthermore, they included '
             'TIF studies with different iterations of the device and the '
             'procedure, which has significantly changed over time, as is the '
             'case with many promising innovations. Finally, the choice of '
             'primary outcomes was arbitrary and differed from the primary '
             'outcomes many of the included trials evaluated. Improvement in '
             'HRQOL, resolution of problematic reflux symptoms, and '
             'esophagitis are arguably the most important patient-centered '
             'outcomes. The authors focused instead on primary outcomes that '
             'readily place LNF at an advantage compared with the other 2 '
             'interventions; for example, PPIs, a major player in the author’s '
             'own design for this network meta-analysis, would not impact LES '
             'pressures at all. Thus, the reader is left puzzled why the '
             'authors selected the primary outcome of LES pressure increase in '
             'this context.The authors repeatedly surmised that LNF is the '
             'gold standard measure for GERD treatment and overstated its '
             'safety in the discussion. These statements are not congruent '

             'regarding the need for reporting these so-called minor '

             'normal postoperative course that might be very disturbing from a '
             'patient perspective. For example, abdominal pain, postoperative '

             'patients will not have a clear picture of the potential harms of '
             'a given procedure. Second, clinicians not aware of their own '

             'improving their outcomes. Third, a comparison between different '

{'abstract': 'BackgroundThe fecal microbiome is associated with prostate '

             'associated with disease, and develop a microbiome risk profile '
             'for prostate cancer.Design, setting, and participantsAfter '
             'prospective collection of 133 rectal swab samples 2 wk before '
             'the transrectal prostate biopsy, we perform 16S rRNA amplicon '
             'sequencing on 105 samples (64 with cancer, 41 without cancer). '
             'Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of '
             'Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was applied to infer functional '

             'identified significant associations between total community '
             'composition and cancer/non-cancer status (Bray-Curtis distance '
             'metric, p<0.01). We identified significant differences in '
             'enrichments of Bacteroides and Streptococcus species in cancer '
             '(all p<0.04). Folate (LDA 3.8) and arginine (LDA 4.1) were the '
             'most significantly altered pathways. We formed a novel '

             'with a high likelihood of prostate cancer (eg, PSA >20) for the '

             'several factors in which the intestinal microbiome could be '
             'involved in men diagnosed with prostate cancer:1.Microbiome '
             'analysis on men undergoing prostate biopsy noted mostly '
             'overlapping bacterial communities between those with and without '
             'prostate cancer.2.Bacteria associated with carbohydrate '
             'metabolism pathways were in abundance, and natural B-vitamin '
             'production was lacking in patients with prostate cancer.3.The '
             'identification of a new 10-microbiome metabolic pathway score '
             'may provide an additional risk factor for prostate cancer, which '
             'is potentially modifiable. We noted overlap in bacterial '
             'community analysis in principal component analysis between '
             'cancer and non-cancer patients. We found subtle differences '
             'within groups of bacteria regarding specific metabolism '
             'pathways, which may be informative to individual patients at '
             'high risk. Unfortunately, as a microbiome score, the AUC for '
             'prostate cancer prediction is suboptimal (AUC=0.64) despite '
             'being statistically significant; therefore, while the findings '
             'are of biological interest, the microbiome score or individual '

{'abstract': 'Rationale: Premature birth affects 10% of live births in the '

             'effects of prematurity on right ventricular and pulmonary '
             'vascular hemodynamics. Methods: Preterm subjects (n=11) were '
             'recruited from the Newborn Lung Project, a prospectively '
             'followed cohort at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, born '

             'had higher mean pulmonary arterial pressures (mPAP), with 27% '
             '(3/11) meeting criteria for borderline pulmonary hypertension '
             '(mPAP 19-24 mmHg) and 18% (2/11) meeting criteria for overt '
             'pulmonary hypertension (mPAP ≥25 mmHg). Pulmonary vascular '
             'resistance and elastance were higher at rest and during '

{'abstract': 'Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) recurrence rates vary '
             'widely in the published literature, with limited data describing '
             'the factors that influence recurrence. The aims of this '
             'systematic review were to determine an estimation of PSP '
             'recurrence rates and describe risk factors for recurrence.A '
             'systematic review was conducted of all studies reporting PSP '
             'recurrence. Electronic searches were performed to identify '
             'English language publications of randomised trials and '
             'observational studies. The population was adults with PSP, who '
             'underwent conservative management, pleural aspiration or chest '
             'drainage. The outcome of interest was recurrence. Articles were '
             'screened, and data extracted from eligible studies by two '
             'reviewers.Of 3607 identified studies, 29 were eligible for '
             'inclusion, comprising 13,548 patients. Pooled 1-year and overall '
             'recurrence rates were 29.0%(95% CI 20.9% to 37.0%) and 32.1%(95% '
             'CI 27.0% to 37.2%) respectively. Female gender was associated '
             'with increased recurrence, OR 3.0(95% CI 1.24 to 7.41), whilst '
             'smoking cessation was associated with fourfold decrease in risk, '
             'OR 0.26(95% CI 0.10 to 0.63). I2 for random effects '
             'meta-analysis was 94%(p<0.0001) reflecting high heterogeneity '
             'between studies.This systematic review demonstrates a 32% PSP '
             'recurrence rate, with greatest risk in the first year. Female '
             'gender was associated with higher risk, suggesting possible '

{'abstract': 'Intestinal homeostasis depends on a slowly proliferating stem '
             'cell compartment in crypt cells, followed by rapid proliferation '
             'of committed progenitor cells in the transit amplifying (TA) '
             'compartment. The balance between proliferation and '
             'differentiation in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) is regulated by '
             'Wnt/β-catenin signaling, although the mechanism remains unclear. '
             'We previously targeted PORCN, an enzyme essential for all Wnt '
             'secretion, and demonstrated that stromal production of Wnts was '
             'required for intestinal homeostasis. Here, a PORCN inhibitor was '
             'used to acutely suppress Wnt signaling. Unexpectedly, the '
             'treatment induced an initial burst of proliferation in the stem '
             'cell compartment of the small intestine, due to conversion of '
             'ISCs into TA cells with a loss of intrinsic ISC self-renewal. '
             'This process involved MAPK pathway activation, as the '
             'proliferating cells in the base of the intestinal crypt '
             'contained phosphorylated ERK1/2, and a MEK inhibitor attenuated '
             'the proliferation of ISCs and their differentiation into TA '
             'cells. These findings suggest a role for Wnt signaling in '
             'suppressing the MAPK pathway at the crypt base to maintain a '
             'pool of ISCs. The interaction between Wnt and MAPK pathways in '
             'vivo has potential therapeutic applications in cancer and '
             'regenerative medicine.',

             'cancer. Over a 10-yr period, a total of 625 patients were '
             'treated with various protocols of focal HIFU in nine centres. '
             'Patients were selected for focal HIFU based on mpMRI findings '
             'and a mixture of systematic and targeted biopsies. Up to two '
             'retreatments with HIFU were allowed without being considered to '
             'have failed focal therapy. The primary endpoint of this study '
             'was failure-free survival (FFS), defined as avoidance of salvage '
             'local therapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy, or the '
             'development of metastases. Of note, prostate biopsies were not '
             'mandated as part of follow-up, and determination of cancer '
             'status was primarily undertaken using a combination of '
             'prostate-specific antigen testing and mpMRI scans. Secondary '
             'endpoints included metastasis-free survival (MFS), '
             'complications, and urinary and sexual function outcomes in those '
             'patients who returned validated questionnaires. With a median '
             'follow-up of 56 mo (interquartile range 35–70), the authors '
             'report FFS of 99% at 1 yr and 88% at 5 yr, with MFS of 98% at 5 '
             'yr using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Complication rates were low, '
             'and among those patients who reported urinary continence '
             'outcomes, 98% were pad free at 1 yr.Although these data are '
             'derived from a prospective registry rather than a strict '
             'multicentre trial, it still provides some interesting and '
             'encouraging data to support the role of focal therapy in men '
             'with clinically significant localised prostate cancer. FFS (at '
             "least by the author's definition) and MFS rates are high, and "
             'complications are low. All the participating centres are '
             'experienced in HIFU and morbidity rates are low. However, there '
             'are a few caveats that must be considered before one can fully '
             'embrace the optimistic conclusions presented in this '
             'paper.First, regarding cancer outcomes, the authors summarise '
             'this nicely in their introduction when they state that “the '
             'survival benefit conferred by radical treatment is often seen '
             'over 10–15 yr when compared to a strategy of active monitoring”. '
             'We must bear this in mind when interpreting the oncological '
             'outcomes in this study. In terms of MFS in a group of patients '
             'of whom 83% have primary Gleason pattern 3 cancer, one would not '
             'expect hard endpoints such as MFS and prostate cancer–specific '
             'mortality to become relevant with a median follow-up of <5 yr. '
             'Furthermore, the very low rates of salvage local therapy seen in '
             'this study (only eight patients [1.3%] underwent salvage radical '
             'prostatectomy [RP]; 36 (5.8%) underwent salvage radiotherapy '
             '[RT]) do not necessarily reflect excellent local control rates. '
             'Rather, they may reflect the lack of biopsy-driven determination '
             'of cancer status in this registry. Only one-third of patients '
             'underwent biopsy; therefore, the true rate of persisting and/or '
             'recurrent cancer in these patients is unknown. Whether with '
             'longer follow-up this manifests as an increased rate of '
             'metastases is unknown.Second, regarding functional outcomes, it '
             'is noted that less than one-third of patients returned '
             'questionnaires on pad use and leakage. However, it is reported '
             'that 80% of patients were pad free, leak free continent at the '
             '2–3-yr time point, with only 2% of patients requiring a pad for '
             'social continence. Data on sexual function are not reported in '
             'the present study. Clearly, the low rate of returned '
             'questionnaires makes it difficult to comment definitively on '
             'these quality of life measures, but one can at least observe '
             'that these outcomes look encouraging within these limitations, '
             'when compared with RP or RT [9x[9]Hamdy, F.C., Donovan, J.L.,and '
             'Neal, D.E. 10-year outcomes in localized prostate cancer. N Engl '

             'References][9].Notwithstanding any of these uncertainties, there '
             'is an inevitable conclusion here, which applies not only to '
             'focal therapy for clinically significant cancer, but also to the '
             'role of imaging in the early detection of localised prostate '
             'cancer. That is, if patients and clinicians are going to fully '

{'abstract': 'BackgroundIsocyanates are major causes of occupational asthma, '
             'but susceptibility and mechanisms of diisocyanate-induced asthma '

             'identify DA-associated functional genetic variants through '
             'next-generation sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics, and functional '
             'assays.MethodsNGS was performed in 91 workers with DA. Fourteen '
             'loci with known DA-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms '
             '(SNPs) were sequenced and compared with data from 238 unexposed '
             'subjects. Ranking of DA-associated SNPs based on their '
             'likelihood to affect gene regulatory mechanisms in the lung '
             'yielded 21 prioritized SNPs. Risk and nonrisk oligonucleotides '
             'were tested for binding of nuclear extracts from A549, BEAS-2B, '
             'and IMR-90 lung cell lines by using electrophoretic mobility '
             'shift assays. DNA constructs were cloned into a pGL3 promoter '
             'vector for luciferase gene reporter assays.ResultsNGS detected '
             '130 risk variants associated with DA (3.1×10−6 to 6.21×10−4), '
             '129 of which were located in noncoding regions. The 21 SNPs '
             'prioritized by using functional genomic data sets were in or '
             'proximal to 5 genes: cadherin 17 (CDH17; n=10), activating '
             'transcription factor 3 (ATF3; n=7), family with sequence '
             'similarity, member A (FAM71A; n=2), tachykinin receptor 1 '
             '(TACR1; n=1), and zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein '
             '16 (ZBTB16; n=1). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays detected '
             'allele-dependent nuclear protein binding in A549cells for 8 of '
             '21 variants. In the luciferase assay 4 of the 21 SNPs exhibited '
             'allele-dependent changes in gene expression. DNA affinity '
             'precipitation and mass spectroscopy of rs147978008 revealed '
             'allele-dependent binding of H1 histones, which was confirmed by '
             'using Western blotting.ConclusionsWe identified 5 DA-associated '

             'gene regulation (ATF rs11571537, CDH17 rs2446824 and rs2513789, '
             'and TACR1 rs2287231). Afifth variant (FAM71A rs147978008) showed '
             'nonrisk allele preferential binding to H1 histones. These '
             'results demonstrate that many DA-associated genetic variants '

             'occurring after a major urological surgery (ie, radical '
             'prostatectomy, radical cystectomy, or radical/partial '
             'nephrectomy) could lead to a higher rate of '
             'complications.Indeed, a recently published paper was really '
             'interesting, showing how the implementation of the EAU '

             'particularly true for grade I-II complications.By definition, we '
             'consider grade I complication as “any deviation from the normal '
             'postoperative course without the need for pharmacological '
             'treatment or surgical, endoscopic, and radiological '
             'interventions”, with some therapeutic regimens allowed. The key '
             'question is—what is the “normal postoperative course” after a '
             'given intervention? The very honest report of complications '
             'leads to impressively high rates of complications even in '
             'tertiary centers, far from the accepted published average. For '
             'example, in many datasets, the ileus is reported as a '
             'complication. Do we really believe that this should represent a '
             'grade I complication, particularly after cystectomy or radical '
             'prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection? And what about '
             'the occurrence of a nonsymptomatic lymphocele after pelvic lymph '
             'nodes dissection, incidentally detected by ultrasonography '
             'during the postoperative course? Is it a deviation from the '
             'normal postoperative course? Or is it an expected consequence of '
             'the removal of the local lymphatic drainage? I am sure there '
             'will be inconsistency in reporting, or not, such complications '
             'by different centers. This is to say that I agree with the '
             'standardized report of complications but maybe a “grade 0” '
             'complication category should be implemented in the currently '

{'abstract': 'PurposeMindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown '
             'to alleviate psychological distress in patients with cancer. '
             'However, patients experience barriers to participating in '
             'face-to-face MBCT. Individual Internet-based MBCT (eMBCT) could '
             'be an alternative. The study aim was to compare MBCT and eMBCT '
             'with treatment as usual (TAU) for psychological distress in '
             'patients with cancer.Patients and MethodsWe obtained ethical and '
             'safety approval to include 245 patients with cancer with '
             'psychological distress (≥ 11 on the Hospital Anxiety and '
             'Depression Scale) in the study. They were randomly allocated to '
             'MBCT (n = 77), eMBCT (n = 90), or TAU (n = 78). Patients '
             'completed baseline (T0) and postintervention (T1) assessments. '
             'The primary outcome was psychological distress on the Hospital '
             'Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes were '
             'psychiatric diagnosis, fear of cancer recurrence, rumination, '
             'health-related quality of life, mindfulness skills, and positive '
             'mental health. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using linear '
             'mixed modeling on the intention-to-treat sample. Because both '
             'interventions were compared with TAU, the type I error rate was '
             'set at P < .025.ResultsCompared with TAU, patients reported '
             'significantly less psychological distress after both MBCT '
             '(Cohen’s d, .45; P < .001) and eMBCT (Cohen’s d, .71; P < .001) '
             '. In addition, post-treatment prevalence of psychiatric '
             'diagnosis was lower with both MBCT (33% improvement; P = .030) '
             'and eMBCT (29% improvement; P = .076) in comparison with TAU '
             '(16%), but these changes were not statistically significant. '
             'Both interventions reduced fear of cancer recurrence and '
             'rumination, and increased mental health–related quality of life, '
             'mindfulness skills, and positive mental health compared with TAU '

             'the biological implication of its abnormality, especially at the '

             'contributes to MM pathogenesis. Herein, we identified that the '

{'abstract': 'The obesity epidemic is accompanied by a worldwide burden of '
             'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that manifests from '
             'simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), '
             'possibly evolving into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although '
             'much attention has been focused on NAFLD, its pathogenesis '
             'remains largely obscure. The hallmark of NAFLD is the hepatic '
             'accumulation of lipids subsequently leading to cellular stress '
             'and hepatic injury, which eventually results in chronic liver '
             'disease. Abnormal lipid accumulation often coincides with '
             'insulin resistance in steatotic livers and is associated with '
             'perturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis in '
             'hepatocytes. In response to chronic ER stress, an adaptive '
             'signaling pathway known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) '
             'is triggered initially to restore ER proteostasis. The UPR can '

             'treatment, offering novel therapeutic avenues. Herein, we '

             'European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR). Data of adult LTs '
             'performed between January 2007 to June 2017 for HCV, hepatitis B '
             'virus (HBV), alcohol (EtOH) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis '
             '(NASH) were analyzed. The period was divided into different '
             'eras: interferon (IFN/RBV; 2007-2010), protease inhibitor (PI; '
             '2011-2013) and second generation DAA (DAA; 2014-June '
             '2017).ResultsOut of a total number of 60,527 LTs, 36,382 were '
             'performed in patients with HCV, HBV, EtOH and NASH. The '
             'percentage of LTs due to HCV-related liver disease varied '
             'significantly over time (p\u202f<0.0001), decreasing from 22.8% '
             'in the IFN/RBV era to 17.4% in the DAA era, while those '
             'performed for NASH increased significantly (p\u202f<0.0001). In '
             'the DAA era, the percentage of LTs for HCV decreased '

             'hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with HCV (HCV-HCC, '
             '−41.2%). Conversely, three-year survival of LT recipients with '

             '0.3807).ConclusionsIn Europe, the number of LTs due to HCV '
             'infection is rapidly declining for both HCV-DC and HCV-HCC '
             'indications and post-LT survival has dramatically improved over '
             'the last three years. This is the first comprehensive study of '
             'the overall impact of DAA treatment for HCV on liver '
             'transplantation in Europe.Lay summaryAfter the advent of '
             'direct-acting antivirals in 2014, a dramatic decline was '
             'observed in the number of liver transplants performed both in '
             'patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus '
             '(HCV), minus 60%, and in those with hepatocellular carcinoma '
             'associated with HCV, minus 41%. Furthermore, this is the first '
             'large-scale study demonstrating that the survival of liver '
             'transplant recipients with HCV-related liver disease has '
             'dramatically improved over the last three years and is now '
             'comparable to the survival of recipients with hepatitis B virus '
             'infection. The reduction in HCV-related indications for LT means '
             'that there is a greater availability of livers, at least 600 '
             'every year, which can be allocated to patients with indications '
             'other than HCV.',

             'Information Database (GRID) to identify patients presenting with '
             'high-grade prostate cancer and compared relevant expression '
             'signatures for those with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values '
             '2.5 ng/ml. They found that features of neuroendocrine/small cell '
             'were marginally increased and androgen receptor activity scores '
             'were decreased among patients presenting with a PSA <2.5 ng/ml. '
             'The authors also examined clinical outcomes in cohorts of '
             'patients presenting with low PSA values derived from two large '
             'cancer registries: the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results '
             '(SEER) and the National Cancer Database (NCDB). They report a '
             'U-shaped distribution of hazard ratios among patients with '
             'very-low PSA levels (eg, <2.5 ng/ml). This could be the result '
             'of a cohort enriched with neuroendocrine tumors, as suggested by '
             'the authors, but could also be the result of systematic errors '
             'in data entry.Our group has demonstrated a significant rate of '
             'PSA errors in cancer registries, particularly for entries '
             'reporting to have very low and very high values. These errors '
             'can be traced to the “site-specific format” used to enter PSA '
             'values, which requires an implied decimal point. For example, '
             'registrars should enter “024” for a PSA value of 2.4 ng/ml. This '
             'format commonly leads to decimal point errors in PSA values '
             'included in cancer registries. We have evaluated these errors in '
             'the VA Central Cancer Registry (VACCR), which uses the '
             '“site-specific format” and contributes data to both SEER and '
             'NCDB. By linking VACCR PSA values with values abstracted from '
             'the electronic health record, we have found that more than half '
             'of patients with prostate cancer and PSA levels <1.0 ng/ml had '
             'significant PSA errors [2x[2]Mittakanti, H.R., Thomas, I.C., '

             'References][2].In response to Mahal et al, we compared the PSA '
             'reported in the VACCR with the gold standard electronic health '
             'record values for the 6440 patients presenting with a PSA <2.5 '
             'ng/ml. We found important differences in the PSA values. For '
             'example, the median PSA level reported by the registry was 1.1 '
             'ng/ml (25th to 75th percentile, 0.6–1.7), whereas the median PSA '
             'level from the corresponding electronic health record was 3.4 '
             'ng/ml (25th to 75th percentile, 1.6–8.4). Overall, we found that '
             '46% of VACCR entries likely represented decimal point errors. '
             'Moreover, we recently demonstrated that low PSA cohorts derived '
             'from cancer registry PSA data overestimate patient mortality '
             '[3x[3]Guo DP, Thomas IC, Mittakanti HR, et al., The research '

             'U-shaped distribution of the hazard ratios reported by Mahal et '
             'al are the decimal point errors in patients reported to have '
             'very low PSA levels (eg, <2.5 ng/ml). Given that the true PSA '
             'level for a significant fraction of their patients was higher '
             'than recorded, the observed elevated hazards of prostate '
             'cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality are likely '
             'inflated.As the authors note, SEER has discovered these coding '
             'errors and taken steps to correct them for patients diagnosed '
             'between 2004 and 2013 in its most recent release [4x[4]Values, '

             'References][4]. However, PSA data from the NCDB has not been '
             'corrected, and the PSA error rates we observe in the VACCR '
             'likely reflect data from NCDB broadly. As access to “big data” '
             'resources such as cancer registries becomes widely available, it '

             'important for the pathogenesis of hepatic I/R injury.Background '
             '& AimsThe comprehensive interplay in sterile inflammation and '
             'liver cell death predominantly determines hepatic injury caused '
             'by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) insult. Caspase recruitment domain '
             'family member 6 (CARD6) was initially shown to play important '
             'roles in NF-κB activation. In our preliminary studies, CARD6 '
             'downregulation was closely related to hepatic I/R injury in '
             'liver transplantation patients and mouse models. Thus, we '
             'hypothesized that CARD6 protects against hepatic I/R injury and '
             'investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms.MethodsA '
             'partial hepatic I/R operation was performed in '
             'hepatocyte-specific Card6 knockout mice (HKO), Card6 transgenic '
             'mice with CARD6 overexpression specifically in hepatocytes '
             '(HTG), and the corresponding control mice. Hepatic histology, '
             'serum aminotransferase, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, cell '
             'death, and inflammatory signaling were examined to assess liver '
             'damage. The molecular mechanisms of CARD6 function were explored '
             'in vivo and in vitro.ResultsCard6-HTG mice alleviated liver '
             'injury compared with control mice as shown by decreased cell '
             'death, lower serum transaminase levels, and reduced inflammation '
             'and infiltration, whereas Card6-HKO mice had the opposite '
             'phenotype. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of ASK1 and its '
             'downstream effectors JNK and p38 were increased in the livers of '
             'Card6-HKO mice but repressed in those of Card6-HTG mice. '
             'Furthermore, ASK1 knockdown normalized the effect of CARD6 '
             'deficiency on the activation of NF-κB, JNK and p38, while ASK1 '
             'overexpression abrogated the suppressive effect of CARD6. '
             'Finally, CARD6 interacted with Ask1. Mutant CARD6 that lacked '
             'the ability to interact with ASK1 could not inhibit ASK1 and '
             'failed to protect against hepatic I/R injury.ConclusionsCARD6 is '
             'a novel protective factor of hepatic I/R injury that suppresses '
             'inflammation and liver cell death by inhibiting the ASK1 '
             'signaling pathway.Lay SummaryCARD6 participate and play an '
             'important role during the process of liver blood flow '
             'restriction followed by restoring. Through suppressing the '
             'activity of ASK1, CARD6 can protect against hepatocytes injury. '

{'abstract': 'BackgroundWhile the probability of malignant versus benign '

             'aggressive versus indolent histology based on radiographic tumor '
             'size.Design, setting, and participantsWe evaluated patients who '
             'underwent radical or partial nephrectomy at Mayo Clinic for a '
             'pT1-2, pNx/0, M0 solid renal tumor between 1990 and 2010. '
             'Pathology was reviewed by one genitourinary pathologist. '
             'High-grade clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), high-grade '
             'papillary RCC, collecting duct RCC, translocation-associated '
             'RCC, hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC, unclassified RCC, and '
             'malignant non-RCC tumors were all considered aggressive, as well '
             'as any tumors demonstrating coagulative necrosis (except '
             'low-grade papillary RCC) or sarcomatoid differentiation. The '
             'remaining benign and malignant tumors were considered '
             'indolent.Outcome measurements and statistical '
             'analysisCancer-specific survival (CSS) was estimated using the '
             'Kaplan-Meier method. Logistic regression models were used to '
             'estimate the probability of malignant and aggressive histology '
             'based on tumor size. Sex-stratified analyses were also '
             'performed.Results and limitationsOf the 2650 patients included, '
             'there were 1860 patients with indolent tumors (300 benign; 1560 '
             'malignant) and 790 with aggressive tumors. The 10-yr CSS was 96% '
             'for indolent malignant tumors and 81% for aggressive malignant '
             'tumors. The predicted percentages of any malignant histology as '
             'well as aggressive histology increased with tumor size. '
             'Specifically, 2cm, 3cm, and 4cm tumors have an estimated 84%, '
             '87%, and 88% likelihood of malignancy, respectively, and an 18%, '
             '24%, and 29% likelihood of aggressive histology, respectively. '
             'For any given tumor size, men had a greater chance of aggressive '
             'histology than women. Potential limitations of this '
             'observational surgical cohort include selection '

             'include the use of a large and robust institutional database '
             'with long-term follow-up. Importantly, all pathology was '
             're-reviewed by one genitourinary pathologist (J.C.C.). There are '
             'also limitations that warrant mentioning. First, as in all '
             'observational studies, we cannot rule out selection bias. '
             'Patients not represented in the cohort include those electing to '
             'undergo active surveillance, those with angiomyolipomas who did '
             'not proceed to surgery, poor surgical candidates, and those with '
             'metastatic disease who were managed with systemic therapy. The '
             'direction of the bias is unknown. We also do not know which '
             'patients underwent active surveillance prior to surgery, '
             'although 86% and 94% of patients in this analysis underwent '
             'surgery within 3 mo and 6 mo of diagnosis, respectively. Second, '
             'the definition of aggressive versus indolent disease is based on '
             'histology in this study. We do not necessarily know how these '
             'tumors may have behaved if not operated upon, although our '
             'survival analyses do suggest a clear difference in outcomes '
             'between aggressive and indolent tumors. Third, we excluded '
             'advanced tumors, such as those with perinephric fat or adjacent '
             'organ invasion, venous tumor thrombus, or nodal or distant '
             'metastases, since we sought to focus on radiologically '
             'indeterminate clinically localized solid renal masses. This may '
             'lead to the underestimation of the probability of malignancy and '
             'aggressive histology among larger tumors. However, large and '
             'advanced tumors likely warrant surgery or systemic therapy, and '
             'as such, estimating the probability of aggressive histology is '
             'not as clinically relevant. Fourth, we did not consider '
             'radiographic characteristics, including nephrometry score, in '
             'this analysis. This will be evaluated in a future study. '
             'Finally, we used the maximum linear radiographic dimension on '
             'computed tomography scan rather than volumetric measurements. '
             'While the latter may represent a more precise quantification of '
             'tumor size, we elected to use linear measurements so that our '
             'data would be more readily translated to daily clinical '
             'practice, where the maximum linear dimension is most widely used '
             'and easiest to ascertain.Jump to Section1. Introduction2. '

{'abstract': 'Background & AimsMAF bZIP transcription factor G (MAFG) is '
             'activated by the farnesoid X receptor to repress bile acid '
             'synthesis. However, expression of MAFG increases during '
             'cholestatic liver injury in mice and in cholangiocarcinomas. '
             'MAFG interacts directly with methionine adenosyltransferase α1 '
             '(MATα1) and other transcription factors at the E-box element to '
             'repress transcription. We studied mechanisms of MAFG '
             'up-regulation in cholestatic tissues and the pathways by which '
             'S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) '
             'prevent the increase in MAFG expression. We also investigated '
             'whether obeticholic acid (OCA), an farnesoid X receptor agonist, '
             'affects MAFG expression and how it contributes to tumor growth '
             'in mice.MethodsWe obtained 7 human cholangiocarcinoma specimens '
             'and adjacent non-tumor tissues from patients that underwent '
             'surgical resection in California and 113 hepatocellular '
             'carcinoma (HCC) specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues from '
             'China, along with clinical data from patients. Tissues were '
             'analyzed by immunohistochemistry. MAT1A, MAT2A, c-MYC, and MAFG '
             'were overexpressed or knocked down with small interfering RNAs '
             'in MzChA-1, KMCH, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells; some cells were '
             'incubated with lithocholic acid (LCA, which causes the same '
             'changes in gene expression observed during chronic cholestatic '
             'liver injury in mice), SAMe, UDCA (100 μM), or farnesoid X '
             'receptor agonists. MAFG expression and promoter activity were '
             'measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, '
             'and transient transfection. We performed electrophoretic '
             'mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to '
             'study proteins that occupy promoter regions. We studied mice '
             'with bile-duct ligation, orthotopic cholangiocarcinomas, '
             'cholestasis-induced cholangiocarcinoma, '
             'diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors, and xenograft '
             'tumors.ResultsLCA activated expression of MAFG in HepG2 and '
             'MzChA-1 cells, which required the activator protein-1, nuclear '
             'factor–κB, and E-box sites in the MAFG promoter. LCA reduced '
             'expression of MAT1A but increased expression of MAT2A in cells. '
             'Overexpression of MAT2A increased activity of the MAFG promoter, '
             'whereas knockdown of MAT2A reduced it. MAT1A and MAT2A had '
             'opposite effects on the activator protein-1, nuclear factor–κB, '
             'and E-box–mediated promoter activity. Expression of MAFG and '
             'MAT2A increased, and expression of MAT1A decreased, in '
             'diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors in mice. SAMe and UDCA '
             'had shared and distinct mechanisms of preventing LCA-mediated '
             'increased expression of MAFG. OCA increased expression of MAFG, '
             'MAT2A, and c-MYC, but reduced expression of MAT1A. Incubation of '
             'human liver and biliary cancer cells lines with OCA promoted '
             'their proliferation; in nude mice given OCA, xenograft tumors '
             'were larger than in mice given vehicle. Levels of MAFG were '
             'increased in human HCC and cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared '
             'with non-tumor tissues. High levels of MAFG in HCC samples '

             'carcinoma.Background & AimsCarcinogen-induced mouse models of '
             'liver cancer are used extensively to study the pathogenesis of '
             'the disease and are critical for validating candidate '
             'therapeutics. These models can recapitulate molecular and '
             'histological features of human disease. However, it is not known '
             'if the genomic alterations driving these mouse tumour genomes '
             'are comparable to those found in human tumours. Herein, we '
             'provide a detailed genomic characterisation of tumours from a '
             'commonly used mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma '
             '(HCC).MethodsWe analysed whole exome sequences of liver tumours '
             'arising in mice exposed to diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Mutational '
             'signatures were compared between liver tumours from DEN-treated '
             'and untreated mice, and human HCCs.ResultsDEN-initiated tumours '
             'had a high, uniform number of somatic single nucleotide variants '
             '(SNVs), with few insertions, deletions or copy number '
             'alterations, consistent with the known genotoxic action of DEN. '
             'Exposure of hepatocytes to DEN left a reproducible mutational '
             'imprint in resulting tumour exomes which we could '
             'computationally reconstruct using six known COSMIC mutational '
             'signatures. The tumours carried a high diversity of '
             'low-incidence, non-synonymous point mutations in many oncogenes '
             'and tumour suppressors, reflecting the stochastic introduction '
             'of SNVs into the hepatocyte genome by the carcinogen. We '
             'identified four recurrently mutated genes that were putative '
             'oncogenic drivers of HCC in this model. Every neoplasm carried '
             'activating hotspot mutations either in codon 61 of Hras, in '
             'codon 584 of Braf or in codon 254 of Egfr. Truncating mutations '
             'of Apc occurred in 21% of neoplasms, which were exclusively '
             'carcinomas supporting a role for deregulation of Wnt/β-catenin '
             'signalling in cancer progression.ConclusionsOur study provides '
             'detailed insight into the mutational landscape of tumours '
             'arising in a commonly used carcinogen model of HCC, facilitating '
             'the future use of this model to better understand the human '
             'disease.Lay summaryMouse models are widely used to study the '
             'biology of cancer and to test potential therapies. Herein, we '
             'have described the mutational landscape of tumours arising in a '
             'carcinogen-induced mouse model of liver cancer. Since cancer is '
             'a disease caused by genomic alterations, information about the '
             'patterns and types of mutations in the tumours in this mouse '
             'model should facilitate its use to study human liver cancer.Jump '

             'physical exercise by cancer patients both as a treatment and as '
             'a preventive measure. However, the article also raises concerns '
             'about the feasibility of such an approach in the whole pool of '
             'unselected cancer patients, because the often-weakening effects '
             'of any treatment with curative intent, possibly coupled to '
             'patient fragility and comorbidity, could reduce the proportion '
             'of eligible individuals. Moreover, the editorial calls for '
             'caution when looking at the actual body of evidence on which the '
             'recommendation to exercise is based. Indeed, despite the number '
             'of clinical trials currently in progress that are testing '
             'exercise as a therapeutic treatment, no specific study has yet '
             'shown that exercising can increase cancer survival.The benefits '
             'related to physical exercise might be due, at least in part, to '
             'the increase in calories burned. In this context, it has largely '
             'been hypothesized that caloric restriction slows down prostate '

{'abstract': 'Background & AimsThe American Consortium of Early Liver '
             'Transplantation for Alcoholic Hepatitis comprises 12 centers '
             'from 8 United Network for Organ Sharing regions studying early '
             'liver transplantation (LT) (without mandated period of sobriety) '
             'for patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH). We analyzed '
             'the outcomes of these patients.MethodsWe performed a '
             'retrospective study of consecutive patients with a diagnosis of '
             'severe AH and no prior diagnosis of liver disease or episodes of '
             'AH, who underwent LT before 6 months of abstinence from 2006 '
             'through 2017 at 12 centers. We collected data on baseline '
             'characteristics, psychosocial profiles, level of alcohol '
             'consumption before LT, disease course and treatment, and '
             'outcomes of LT. The interval of alcohol abstinence was defined '
             'as the time between last drink and the date of LT. The primary '
             'outcomes were survival and alcohol use after LT, defined as slip '
             'or sustained.ResultsAmong 147 patients with AH who received '
             'liver transplants, the median duration of abstinence before LT '
             'was 55 days; 54% received corticosteroids for AH and the '
             'patients had a median Lille score of 0.82 and a median Sodium '
             'Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 39. Cumulative '
             'patient survival percentages after LT were 94% at 1 year (95% '
             'confidence interval [CI], 89%–97%) and 84% at 3 years (95% CI, '
             '75%–90%). Following hospital discharge after LT, 72% were '
             'abstinent, 18% had slips, and 11% had sustained alcohol use. The '
             'cumulative incidence of any alcohol use was 25% at 1 year (95% '
             'CI, 18%–34%) and 34% at 3 years (95% CI, 25%–44%) after LT. The '
             'cumulative incidence of sustained alcohol use was 10% at 1 year '
             '(95% CI, 6%–18%) and 17% at 3 years (95% CI, 10%–27%) after LT. '
             'In multivariable analysis, only younger age was associated with '
             'alcohol following LT (P= .01). Sustained alcohol use after LT '
             'was associated with increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 4.59; '
             'P= .01).ConclusionsIn a retrospective analysis of 147 patients '
             'who underwent early LT (before 6 months of abstinence) for '
             'severe AH, we found that most patients survive for 1year (94%) '
             'and 3 years (84%), similar to patients receiving '
             'livertransplants for other indications. Sustained alcohol use '
             'after LT was infrequent but associated with increased mortality. '
             'Our findings support the selective use of LT as a treatment for '
             'severe AH. Prospective studies are needed to optimize selection '

             'determine whether alterations in the synaptic proteome were '
             'associated with resilience to psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer’s '
             'disease and, if present, were independent of neuropathologic '
             'burden.Quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to measure '
             'multiple neuropathologies in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from '
             'subjects with early and middle-stage Alzheimer’s disease who '
             'differed in psychosis status. Synaptic proteins were quantified '

             'This phase II, randomized, double-blind study evaluated whether '
             'addition of the PARP inhibitor veliparib to TMZ improves 4-month '
             'progression-free survival (PFS).Patients and MethodsA total of '
             '104 patients with recurrent SCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to '
             'oral veliparib or placebo 40 mg twice daily, days 1 to 7, and '
             'oral TMZ 150 to 200 mg/m2/day, days 1 to 5, of a 28-day cycle '
             'until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal '
             'of consent. Response was determined by imaging at weeks 4 and 8, '
             'and every 8 weeks thereafter. Improvement in PFS at 4 months was '
             'the primary end point. Secondary objectives included overall '

{'abstract': 'This article was published at Annals.org on 13 July 2018.As a '
             'result of the opioid use disorder (OUD) epidemic (1), new '
             'epidemics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infection have '
             'arisen and hospitalizations for bacteremia, endocarditis, skin '
             'and soft tissue infections, and osteomyelitis have increased '
             '(2–4). Optimal treatment of these conditions is often impeded by '
             'untreated OUD resulting in long hospital stays, frequent '
             'readmissions due to lack of adherence to antibiotic regimens or '
             'reinfection, substantial morbidity, and a heavy financial toll '
             'on the health care system. Medical settings that manage such '
             'infections offer a potential means of engaging people in '
             'treatment of OUD; however, few providers and hospitals treating '
             'such infections have the needed resources and capabilities (5). '
             'There is thus an urgent need to implement and scale up effective '
             'OUD treatment in health care settings to address the '
             'intersecting epidemics of OUD and its infectious disease (ID) '
             'consequences (6). The American College of Physicians (7), the '
             'Infectious Diseases Society of America (8), and the National '
             'Institutes of Health (9) have issued calls for action. Providers '
             'who treat the infectious complications of OUD, including ID '
             'physicians, hospitalists, emergency medicine physicians, '
             'intensivists, surgeons, obstetrician-gynecologists, '
             'pediatricians, nurses, advanced practice registered nurses, and '
             'physician assistants are at the forefront of these epidemics and '
             'are well-positioned to integrate OUD treatment in the context of '
             'ID management.To address these intersecting epidemics, the U.S. '
             'Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) requested that '
             'the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine '
             'convene a workshop, “Integrating Infectious Disease '
             'Considerations with Response to the Opioid Epidemic.” The '
             'workshop took place on 12 and 13 March 2018 in Washington, DC, '
             'and participants included ID physicians, hospitalists, primary '
             'care providers, nurses, health policy experts, epidemiologists, '
             'law enforcement personnel, and staff from the DHHS and the '
             'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Videos and slides of '
             'the presentations are available at '
             'http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/Activities/PublicHealth/IntegratingInfectiousDiseaseConsiderationswithResponsetotheOpioidEpidemic/2018_MAR-12.aspx.The '
             'workshop identified parallels between the current opioid '
             'epidemic and the early days of the HIV epidemic. Care of '
             'HIV-infected patients benefited greatly from the development of '
             'a highly trained interdisciplinary workforce and expanded access '
             'to treatment through the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources '
             'Emergency Act (Ryan White CARE Act) and other public health '
             'policies. Workshop participants agreed on the need for '
             'partnership across treatment settings and specialties, increased '
             'access to addiction care and funding, and improvement of '
             'addiction treatment expertise among providers who manage the '
             'infectious complications of OUD. On the basis of the workshop '
             'discussions, we agreed on 5 action steps.Action Step 1: '
             'Implement screening for OUD in all relevant health care '
             'settings. All persons who are evaluated in medical settings for '
             'overdose, endocarditis, bacteremia, skin abscesses, vertebral '
             'osteomyelitis, HIV infection, and HCV infection should be '
             'screened for OUD. The Rapid Opioid Dependence Screen (created by '
             'S.A.S.) (10) takes less than 5 minutes to administer. Because ID '
             'specialists are likely to be consulted for anyone requiring '
             'long-term antibiotic therapy or patients with HIV and HCV '
             'infection, OUD screening should be a standard part of an ID '
             'consult assessment.Action Step 2: For patients with positive '
             'screening results, immediately prescribe effective medication '
             'for OUD and/or opioid withdrawal symptoms. Opioid withdrawal and '
             'pain syndromes should be addressed with opioid agonist therapies '
             'to optimize ID treatment and relieve pain. Although complex pain '
             'syndromes may require initial management with short-acting full '
             'opioid agonists, treatment for OUD can begin as soon as possible '
             'during hospitalization. Three medications that are approved by '
             'the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of OUD '
             'are effective at preventing relapse: methadone, buprenorphine, '
             'and extended-release naltrexone. Methadone and buprenorphine are '
             'opioid agonists that can be used for pain control and also to '
             'treat opioid withdrawal and prevent relapse. Extended-release '
             'naltrexone is a long-acting injectable opioid antagonist that '
             'can be used to prevent relapse. Hospital-based initiation of OUD '
             'medication may enable patients to be retained long enough for '
             'them to complete antibiotic treatment instead of leaving against '
             'medical advice due to opioid cravings or withdrawal symptoms. '
             'Hospitals may also prescribe naloxone rescue kits and refer '
             'patients to needle- and syringe-exchange programs.Action Step 3: '
             'Develop hospital-based protocols that facilitate OUD treatment '
             'initiation and linkage to community-based treatment upon '
             'discharge. Most hospitals do not offer medication for OUD during '
             'hospitalization and rely on passive referrals to community-based '
             'addiction treatment programs, a strategy that is rarely '
             'effective. Hospital pharmacy committees should stock '
             'FDA-approved medications for OUD. Clinical protocols for '
             'integration of addiction treatment for hospitalized patients and '
             'technical assistance to support implementation can be developed. '
             'Hospitals should partner with community-based programs and '
             'skilled-nursing facilities to provide seamless transitions in '
             'care for people with OUD and serious infections. Protocols for '
             'pregnant women with OUD are needed, including those to reduce '
             'neonatal abstinence syndrome.Action Step 4: Hospitals, medical '
             'schools, physician assistant schools, nursing schools, and '
             'residency programs should increase training to identify and '
             'treat OUD. All prescribers and other hospital personnel should '
             'receive training on Drug Addiction Treatment Act waivers (an '
             'authorization for clinicians to prescribe buprenorphine for '
             'treatment of OUD). Hospitals should ensure that buprenorphine '
             'prescribers are available for hospitalized patients. '
             'Buprenorphine waiver training is available through the Providers '
             'Clinical Support System (https://pcssnow.org), which is funded '
             'by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services '
             'Administration. Clinicians should also be trained in how to '

             'Medicaid and other insurance and require that insurers cover '
             'FDA-approved treatments for OUD without cumbersome '

             'underinsured persons with HIV, may be an appropriate model for '

             'Prospective, consecutive cohort with point-of-care data of '
             'patients of Silver Chain Hospice Care 2011–2014 (n=4638; 51,494 '

             'Scale (NRS)) and physical function (Australia-modified Karnofsky '
             'Performance Scale (AKPS)) were measured each visit. Time was '
             'anchored at death. Breathlessness trajectory was analysed by '
             'physical function and diagnosis using mixed effects '
             'regression.Results: Mean age was 71.5 (sd 15.1) years; 55.2% '

             '26.8%. Breathlessness was worst in people with '

             'were randomly assigned to the ASAP intervention program plus '

             'focuses on emotion regulation and safety planning, is a 3-hour '
             'intervention delivered on the inpatient unit. The BRITE app '
             'prompted participants to rate their level of emotional distress '

             'therapeutic discovery provides an opportunity to develop complex '
             'models from which we can attempt to draw insights. Conceptually '
             'these could provide a more clinically relevant model compared, '
             'for example, to cell line experiments or genomic or gene '
             'expression analyses of tumour samples. However, there are also '
             'some potential challenges. The drop off from 109 samples from 29 '
             'patients to four PDXs from two patients in this work is '
             'substantial, and probably reflects the complexities of '
             'generating and maintaining such models, for which scalability is '
             'a challenge. The authors focussed on these particular PDXs to '
             'represent aggressive tumours, and thus a “high threshold” for '
             'preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic options. However, a '
             'converse perspective is that having exhausted conventional, and '
             'some historical, treatment options, the sampled cancers almost '
             'certainly had heavily treatment-induced genomic changes. '
             'Arguably, in 2018 the greatest need is to develop therapeutic '
             'options to reflect the point of emergence of CRPC, or earlier, '
             'rather than at extensively pretreated death. Although described '
             'as “enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant” (one patient '
             'received both), each patient was also exposed to multiple '
             'AR-targeted drugs (both received bicalutamide, nilutamide, '
             'stilboestrol, and dexamethasone, and one patient also received '
             'cyproterone), which are arguably no longer components of modern '
             'therapy but may induce specific AR activating point mutations, '
             'and chemotherapy (both received docetaxel, one received '
             'cabazitaxel). Furthermore, while CRPC may be a disease of nodal '
             'and visceral metastases, it remains commonly dominated by bony '
             'metastatic disease, and often solely this site. These are points '
             'that future application of a PDX model program should ideally '
             'aim to address to attempt to optimise the unique benefits that '
             'this methodology appears to be able to add to other options for '
             'CRPC therapeutics discovery.Notwithstanding these points, I '
             'believe that these data warrant extension of the clinical '
             'evaluation of ribosome-directed therapy to CRPC. One immediate '
             'question for clinical development in CRPC would be the '
             'identification of a patient selection biomarker for '
             'ribosome-directed therapy. p53 status and markers of MYC driven '
             'cancer progression are possible starting options. The data here '
             'perhaps suggest that fresh tumour sampling might be required, '
             'but that this might be complicated by intrapatient tumour '
             'heterogeneity. These are significant challenges for any drug '
             'development programme with competing concerns over scientific '
             'rigour and pragmatism.This work highlights the unique '
             'opportunities and complexities of a PDX model-centred approach '
             'to novel CRPC therapeutic discovery. This does not replace other '
             'methodologies, but it would appear to provide unique '
             'complementation. This opportunity should be embraced to improve '
             'on the currently inadequate treatment options for CRPC.Jump to '

{'abstract': 'Background and objectiveThis study aimed to determine, in men '
             'recently diagnosed with grade group 1 (GG1) prostate cancer, if '
             'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with targeted biopsy could '
             'identify a greater proportion of men with GG ≥2 cancer on their '
             'confirmatory biopsy compared with systematic biopsies. The study '
             'was registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01354171).Design, '
             'setting, and participantsThis study is a prospective, '
             'randomized, multicenter, open-label trial. Eligible patients '
             'were men diagnosed with GG1 cancer within 1 yr prior to study '
             'entry in whom a confirmatory biopsy was indicated. Patients were '
             'randomized to 12-core systematic biopsy or MRI with systematic '
             'and targeted biopsy using the Artemis fusion targeting system. '
             'The primary end point was the proportion upgraded to GG ≥2 in '
             'each arm.Results and limitationsIn total, 296 men were '
             'registered and 273 randomized. Of the MRI group, 64% had a '
             'region of interest. No difference was observed in the rate of GG '
             '≥2 upgrading (the intent-to-treat population, p=0.7, and '
             'per-protocol [PP] population, p=0.4), GG ≥2 upgrading within '
             'each stratum separately, or GG ≥3. After central pathology '
             'review, upgrading was observed in 36/132 (27%) men in the '
             'systematic biopsy arm and 42/127 (33%) men in the MRI arm '
             '(p=0.3). Upgrading was seen in 19/137 (14%) patients in the MRI '
             'arm on targeted biopsy alone (median, 2 cores) compared with '
             '31/136 (23%) in the systematic biopsy arm (median, 12 cores; '
             'p=0.09). In the MRI arm, 8/127 (6.5%) patients had GG ≥2 disease '
             'identified on targeted biopsy, but ≤GG1 on the systematic '
             'biopsy, and 10/127 (7.9%) patients had GG ≥2 disease identified '
             'by systematic biopsy but ≤GG1 on targeted biopsy. Significant '
             'differences in upgrading on targeted biopsies were seen between '
             'sites, likely reflecting different levels of expertise with the '
             'targeted biopsy technique.ConclusionsThe addition of MRI with '
             'targeted biopsies to systematic biopsies did not significantly '
             'increase the upgrading rate compared with systematic biopsy '
             'alone. Furthermore, 2-core targeted biopsies alone resulted in a '
             'nonsignificant trend to less upgrading than 12-core systematic '
             'biopsy (p=0.09). In men on active surveillance, targeted '
             'biopsies identify most, but not all, clinically significant '

             'The study was registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov '

             'used in this study could lead to classification of more lesions '
             'as 3, 4, or 5 compared with PI-RADS version 2 given that '
             'abnormal enhancement in the peripheral zone was given more '

             'site). However, in the third, most experienced site, the '
             'upgrading rate was much higher in the MRI arm (33% vs 20%, '
             'p=0.07).No statistically significant difference was observed in '

             'cores per target may have reduced the detection rates of small '
             'Gleason pattern 4 components in the targets. The Likert system '
             'puts more weight on the DCE MRI than PI-RADS version 2 and does '
             'not use a 15-mm size threshold to distinguish score 4 from 5. '
             'Despite this, the number of cores required for each significant '
             'cancer was dramatically less with the targeted approach (median '
             'of two vs 12 cores).Patients with a Likert 3, 4, or 5 lesion '
             'received one to five targeted biopsies (depending on target '
             'number). The protocol of two cores per target may have been '
             'insufficient to reliably target significant cancers. The 6% of '
             'patients who only had one targeted biopsy were at particular '
             'risk for pathologic miss despite the fusion targeting '
             'technique.Both systematic and targeted biopsies missed some '
             'clinically significant cancers. The likelihood of a positive '
             'systematic biopsy for clinically significant cancer was higher '
             'if a target was present, even if the targeted biopsy was '
             'negative. The likeliest explanation is that the targeted biopsy '
             'missed the lesion, and the systematic biopsy hit it. This '
             'observation may also reflect a field effect, meaning that the '
             'presence of an area of restricted diffusion is associated with '
             'an increased likelihood of significant cancer in the adjacent '
             'region.Despite all MRIs being read centrally by the same '
             'radiologist (MH), there were major differences in the '
             'performance of the targeted biopsies between sites. In '
             'particular, the PPV of a target (Likert 3, 4, or 5) for GG ≥2 at '
             'one site was 33%; at the other two sites, it was 8–10%. This '
             'likely reflects differences in the learning curve between sites. '
             'At these two sites, the upgrading rate for systematic biopsies '
             'alone (29% and 26%) was unexpectedly higher than for '
             'systematic+targeted (10% and 8%). In the MRI arm, the '
             'targeted+systematic biopsies were performed using the Artemis '
             'device, whereas the systematic alone biopsies were performed '
             'using the standard TRUS Bx technique. The use of an image fusion '
             'biopsy system by the less experienced centers may have reduced '
             'the diagnostic yield. The Sunnybrook site had more prior '
             'experience and a consistent operator throughout the course of '
             'the study; the other centers had less experience, several '
             'different operators, and less recruitment, which may have '
             'limited their comfort with the Artemis technology. Both MRI and '
             'systematic biopsy missed significant cancers; targeted biopsy '
             'missed 8% of GG ≥2 cancers found on systematic biopsy, and '
             'systematic biopsy missed 6% of the significant cancers found on '
             'targeted biopsy. Five of 45 patients (11%) with a negative MRI '
             'had GG ≥2 cancers; four of these five were GG2. Only one (2%) '
             'patient with a negative MRI had GG t3 on systematic biopsy. This '
             'suggests that GG2 cancers are more likely to be missed or '
             'underestimated on MRI compared with higher grade cancers.The NPV '

{'abstract': 'Chronic mental illnesses (CMI), such as schizophrenia or '
             'recurrent affective disorders, are complex conditions with both '
             'genetic and non-genetic elements. In many other chronic brain '
             'conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, '
             'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, '
             'sporadic instances of the disease are more common than '
             'gene-driven familial cases. Yet, the pathology of these '
             'conditions can be characterized by the presence of aberrant '
             'protein homeostasis, proteostasis, resulting in misfolded or '
             'aggregated proteins in the brains of patients that predominantly '
             'do not derive from genetic mutations. While visible deposits of '
             'aggregated protein have not yet been detected in CMI patients, '
             'we propose the existence of more subtle protein misassembly in '
             'these conditions, which form a continuum with the psychiatric '
             'phenotypes found in the early stages of many neurodegenerative '
             'conditions. Such proteinopathies need not rely on genetic '
             'variation. In a similar manner to the established aberrant '
             'neurotransmitter homeostasis in CMI, aberrant homeostasis of '
             'proteins is a functional statement that can only partially be '
             'explained by, but is certainly complementary to, genetic '
             'approaches. Here, we review evidence for aberrant proteostasis '
             'signatures from post mortem human cases, in vivo animal work, '
             'and in vitro analysis of candidate proteins misassembled in CMI. '
             'The five best-characterized proteins in this respect are '
             'currently DISC1, dysbindin-1, CRMP1, TRIOBP-1, and NPAS3. '
             'Misassembly of these proteins with inherently unstructured '
             'domains is triggered by extracellular stressors and thus '
             'provides a converging point for non-genetic causes of CMI.',

{'abstract': 'Numerous genetic and functional studies implicate variants of '
             'Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and its neuronal receptor ErbB4 in '
             'schizophrenia and many of its endophenotypes. Although the '
             'neurophysiological and behavioral phenotypes of NRG1 mutant mice '
             'have been investigated extensively, practically nothing is known '
             'about the function of NRG2, the closest NRG1 homolog. We found '
             'that NRG2 expression in the adult rodent brain does not overlap '
             'with NRG1 and is more extensive than originally reported, '
             'including expression in the striatum and medial prefrontal '
             'cortex (mPFC), and therefore generated NRG2 knockout mice (KO) '
             'to study its function. NRG2 KOs have higher extracellular '
             'dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum but lower levels in the '
             'mPFC; a pattern with similarities to dopamine dysbalance in '
             'schizophrenia. Like ErbB4 KO mice, NRG2 KOs performed abnormally '
             'in a battery of behavioral tasks relevant to psychiatric '
             'disorders. NRG2 KOs exhibit hyperactivity in a novelty-induced '
             'open field, deficits in prepulse inhibition, hypersensitivity to '
             'amphetamine, antisocial behaviors, reduced anxiety-like behavior '
             'in the elevated plus maze and deficits in the T-maze alteration '
             'reward test—a task dependent on hippocampal and mPFC function. '
             'Acute administration of clozapine rapidly increased '
             'extracellular dopamine levels in the mPFC and improved '
             'alternation T-maze performance. Similar to mice treated '
             'chronically with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) '
             'antagonists, we demonstrate that NMDAR synaptic currents in NRG2 '
             'KOs are augmented at hippocampal glutamatergic synapses and are '
             'more sensitive to ifenprodil, indicating an increased '
             'contribution of GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Our findings reveal a '
             'novel role for NRG2 in the modulation of behaviors with '
             'relevance to psychiatric disorders.',

             'likelihood of disease recurrence and progression to muscle '

             'cure, albeit with a high risk of morbidity, and is overtreatment '

             'recommended for cases with T1HG BCa. Patients electing a bladder '

             'followed by a maintenance schedule, while patients with several '
             'high-risk features should consider immediate cystectomy and '

             'outdoor air on a daily basis for 4 consecutive years in Munich '
             '(Germany) and Davos (Switzerland). Air was sampled as '
             'Particulate Matter PM>10μm and 10>PM>2.5. LPS was determined '
             'using the recombinant Factor C (rFC) assay.ResultsOver 60% of '

             'Multivariate modelling showed that endotoxin levels could be '
             'explained by phenological parameters i.e. plant growth. Indeed, '
             'days with high airborne endotoxin levels correlated well with '
             'the amount of Artemisia pollen in the air. Pollen collected from '

             'levels of endotoxin were detected on Artemisia vulgaris '
             '(mugwort) pollen, with little on other pollen. Microbiome '

{'abstract': 'BackgroundThe incidence of bilateral and multiple renal stones '

             'underwent simultaneous bilateral endoscopic surgery (SBES), '
             'reporting its effectiveness and safety.Design, setting, and '
             'participantsA prospective analysis of 27 consecutive patients '
             'who underwent simultaneous flexible ureteroscopy (fURS) in one '
             'side and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) in the other side '
             'for bilateral renal stones was performed.Surgical procedureSBES, '
             'performing fURS in one side and PCNL in the other side '
             'contemporaneously.MeasurementsClinical data were collected in a '
             'dedicated database. Intra- and postoperative outcomes were '
             'assessed. Comparisons among pre- and postoperative serum '
             'creatinine levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate '
             'values during the study period were performed using the '
             'Kruskal-Wallis test with the Dunn multiple comparison '
             'test.Results and limitationsAll the procedures were carried out '
             'until the end in both sides without encountering any '
             'complications intraoperatively. The mean stone size was 27.1±8.1 '
             'and 11.1±3.6mm for the PCNL and fURS side respectively. The mean '
             'operative time was 79.4±25.2min. There were no differences in '
             "patients' creatinine and eGFR when comparing at baseline with "
             '1-mo after SBES. No postoperative major complications were '
             'experienced (Clavien-Dindo grade I 3.7%; II 11.1%). Stone-free '
             'rate was 74% at 1-mo follow-up. The main limitation of the study '
             'is the small size of the group analyzed.ConclusionsSBES is safe '
             'and effective, with minimal morbidity. SBES has the potential '

             'supine PCNL and fURS in tandem fashion—that is, one surgeon '
             'performing PCNL while at the same time another surgeon performs '
             'a contralateral fURS. Given the novelty of this practice, we '
             'have named this procedure “SBES” in order to differentiate this '
             'procedure from traditional same-session bilateral procedures '
             'where one kidney is treated to completion followed by treatment '
             'of the contralateral kidney. To summarize our results, SFR were '
             'consistent with previously published reports in the literature '
             'and there were no major complications. Notably, despite '
             'simultaneous manipulation of both kidneys, no patients '
             'experienced renal complications, and there was no change in '
             'serum creatinine and eGFR from baseline to 1-mo follow-up after '
             'surgery. We also note that no patients in our study required '
             'blood transfusion during the perioperative period—this is likely '
             'due to the exclusion of complex staghorn stones both from the '
             'study and potentially from the small sample size.This is a key '
             'point: as emerges from the average diameter of small stones of '
             'our series, ideal candidates to SBES are patients bearing '
             'bilateral small- to medium-size stones who have a high chance to '
             'become stone free and, as a consequence, are unlikely to undergo '
             'a second surgery.It is noteworthy that SBES requires a special '
             'OR setup, a complete endourological armamentarium, and dedicated '
             'nurses in order to allow both surgeons to work simultaneously '
             'and efficiently. Specialized equipment includes two endoscopic '
             'towers (one for each surgeon to view the kidney that each is '
             'operating on). We feel that for the patients in our study in '
             'whom a single-use ureteroscope was used, the smaller mobile '
             'screen associated with this ureteroscope may yield some '

             'This may, in turn, decrease the risk of postoperative shivering '

             'opportunities for the surgeon and hospital are optimized.There '
             'are several limitations to our study. First is the sample '
             'size—this was a pilot study of only 27 patients and was not '
             'randomized. There were no major complications, but a larger '
             'study in the future is necessary to confirm the safety and '
             'efficacy of SBES. However, our data were collected '
             'prospectively, which strengthens our findings. In addition, the '
             'procedure requires two surgeons to operate simultaneously with '
             'specialized equipment, and not all urology departments have the '
             'equipment, personnel, or bandwidth to accomplish this. '
             'Nonetheless, we feel our results are encouraging and that SBES '

{'abstract': 'Rationale: We examined whether increased rifampin doses could '
             'shorten standard therapy for tuberculosis without increased '
             'toxicity. Objectives: To assess the differences across three '
             'daily oral doses of rifampin in change in elimination rate of '
             'Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum and frequency of '
             'rifampin-related adverse events. Methods: We conducted a '
             'blinded, randomized, controlled Phase II clinical trial of 180 '
             'adults with new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, '
             'susceptible to isoniazid and rifampin. We randomized 1:1:1 to '
             '10, 15, and 20 mg/kg/day of rifampin during the intensive phase. '
             'We report the primary efficacy and safety endpoints: change in '
             'elimination rate of M. tuberculosis log10 colony forming units '
             'and frequency of grade 2 or higher rifampin-related adverse '
             'events. We report efficacy by treatment arm and by primary '
             '(AUC/MIC) and secondary (AUC) pharmacokinetic exposure. '
             'Measurements and Main Results: Each 5 mg/kg/day increase in '
             'rifampin dose resulted in differences of -0.011 (95%CI, -0.025 – '
             '+0.002;P=0.230) and -0.022 (95%CI, -0.046 – -0.002;P=0.022) '
             'log10 colony forming units/mL/day in the modified '
             'intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, respectively. '
             'Elimination rate in the per-protocol population increased '
             'significantly with rifampin AUC0-6 (P=0.011) but not with '
             'AUC0-6/MIC99.9 (P=0.053). Grade 2 or higher rifampin-related '
             'adverse events occurred with similar frequency across the three '
             'treatment arms: 26(43.3%), 31(51.7%), and 23(38.3%) participants '

{'abstract': 'The voltage-gated potassium channel KV7.1 and the auxiliary '

             'proposed target for future anti-arrhythmic drugs. We previously '
             'showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) activate KV7.1 '
             'via an electrostatic mechanism. The activating effect was '
             'abolished when KV7.1 was co-expressed with KCNE1, as KCNE1 '

             'dataReferencesComparison with the WHO criteriaThe performance of '
             'the TREAT-B score was compared with the WHO criteria for LMICs, '
             'which rely on ALT and APRI without HBV DNA. To select African '
             'patients infected with HBV for antiviral therapy, the AUROCs of '
             'TREAT-B were significantly higher than those of the WHO criteria '
             '(Table 4Table 4, Fig. 4Fig. 4). The WHO criteria demonstrated '
             'high sensitivities (ranging 86–94%), but inadequately low '
             'specificities (40–56%). PABAK, the measure of agreement between '
             'the TREAT-B score and each of the international guidelines, was '
             'also high (ranging from 0.57 to 0.76), compared to that of the '
             'WHO criteria (ranging from −0.03 to 0.19) (Table 4Table 4).In a '
             'subset of Gambian patients who had available data on 2nd ALT '
             'measurement (n\u202f=\u202f472), a sensitivity analysis was '
             'performed by using persistently elevated ALT levels at two '
             'consecutive measurements as one of the WHO criteria. While only '
             '10.4% (49/472) were eligible according to the EASL criteria, a '
             'total of 162 patients (34.2%) were categorized as eligible using '
             'the WHO treatment criteria, resulting in a false positive rate '
             'of 29.6%. Significantly higher AUROCs of TREAT-B than the WHO '
             'criteria were also confirmed in this sensitivity analysis (Table '
             'S4Table S4). The correlation and agreement of ALT levels '
             'measured between the 1st and 2nd ALT measurement were good in '

             'dataReferencesDiscussionThis is the first study that developed '
             'and validated a diagnostic prediction score for treatment '
             'eligibility in African individuals with chronic HBV infection. '
             'Using a unique population-based cohort of Gambian HBV-infected '
             'individuals, we developed a score free from HBV DNA (TREAT-B) on '
             'the basis of ALT level and HBeAg sero-status. In a large '
             'external cohort of African patients living in West Africa or '
             'Europe, we confirmed the high diagnostic accuracy of the new '
             'score. TREAT-B correctly identified 82–85% of patients meeting '
             'the international treatment criteria based on the conventional '
             'reference tests (serum HBV DNA and liver biopsy or Fibroscan), '
             'and 77–78% of patients who do not fulfil these reference '
             'criteria. Moreover, TREAT-B performed well irrespective of the '
             'age groups, HBV genotypes, the presence of obesity, or '
             'cirrhosis, and better than the WHO treatment criteria. The score '
             'including HBV DNA (i.e., REACH-B) did not perform better than '
             'the TREAT-B, supporting the usefulness of TREAT-B even in a '
             'context where HBV DNA measurement is accessible.In HBV-infected '
             'people the level of serum HBV DNA has been one of the most '

             'GSEA and STRING analyses were used to identify key genes and '
             'pathways.Twenty miRNAs and 539 mRNAs were differentially '
             'expressed with CMH in COPD. The expression of 10 miRNAs was '
             'significantly correlated with the expression of one or more '
             'mRNAs. Of these, miR-134-5p, miR146a-5p and the let-7 family had '
             'the highest representation of CMH-associated mRNAs among their '
             'negatively correlated predicted targets. KRAS and EDN1 were '
             'identified as key regulators of CMH and were negatively '
             'correlated predicted targets of miR-134-5p and the '

             'and because evidence shows either the role for STAT3 or STAT1 in '

             'PBMCs or sorted naïve CD4+ T cells from STAT3LOF and STAT1GOF '
             'patients had impaired Th9 generation/differentiation. STAT3 '
             'inhibition in normal Th9 cultures diminished early IL-21 '

{'abstract': 'Rationale : Presence of anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies '
             '(DSAs) is associated with poor outcome after lung '
             'transplantation (LTx). DSAs are currently detected by Luminex '
             'technique, which may be overly sensitive. The new C1q assay '
             'allows for the exclusive detection of complement (C1q)-binding '
             'antibodies, involved in antibody-mediated rejection.Objectives: '
             'To investigate whether early detection of complement-binding '
             'DSAs is associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction '
             '(CLAD) and survival.Methods: From 2009–2012, LTx recipients from '
             '3 transplantation centers were screened for the presence of DSA '
             'and their complement-binding capacity during the 6–12months '
             'post-transplantation in stable condition.Results: The analysis '
             'included 168 patients. The 3-year rates of freedom from CLAD and '
             'graft survival were lower for patients with complement-binding '
             'DSAs (33.6% and 53.7%, respectively), as compared with patients '
             'with non–complement-binding DSAs (61.9% and 77.4%, respectively) '
             'and patients without DSA (70% and 84.9%, respectively) (p<0.001 '
             'and p=0.001,respectively). Detection of complement-binding DSA '
             'was associated with a risk of graft loss that was nearly tripled '
             'after adjustement for clinical, functional, histologic, and '

             '6.66;p=0.008).Conclusion: Assessment of the C1q-binding capacity '
             'of DSA appears to be useful in identifying stable lung '

{'abstract': 'SummaryWhile mutations affecting protein-coding regions have '

             'deep whole-genome and -transcriptome analysis of 101 '
             'castration-resistant prostate cancer metastases (109X tumor/38X '

{'abstract': 'SummaryProteins such as FUS phase separate to form liquid-like '

             'However, how these properties emerge from the collective '

             'post-diagnostic outcomes, it is likely that discovery was '
             'achieved by: (1) reducing genetic variability through the study '
             'of a population of common ancestry, and (2) adjusting for '
             'clinical predictors of disease progression. The authors also '
             'surmise that because the Swedish population participates in a '

             'different male partners at different locations across Europe and '
             'the USA. His medical history included three acute HCV '

             'antiviral regimens shortly following acute infection (Fig. 1Fig. '

             '2016 with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for 12\u202fweeks. At '
             'treatment initiation (t0 in Fig. 1Fig. 1), Sanger sequencing '

             'by Leppert and Brooks cannot simply be extended to the SEER '
             'database as the two databases have completely different quality '
             'assurance processes for the PSA variable.Second, the argument '
             'put forward by Leppert and Brooks relies primarily on their '
             'claim that the VACCR (which was not used for our study) '
             'contributes data to the National Cancer Database (NCDB) '
             'Participant User File (PUF) data that we analyzed as a '

             'out to the NCDB, who which stated that the PUF data released by '
             'the NCDB do not include any data from the VA, as there is not a '
             'data use agreement with the VA that allows the NCDB to share the '

             'for which the rate of PSA errors found on audit was much lower '
             'than predicted, as stated above.Third, despite the fact that the '
             'magnitude of errors discovered in the VACCR database would not '
             'directly apply to the SEER or NCDB data used in our study, it '
             'should be noted that the method used by Leppert and Brooks to '

             'Most notably, the authors used a method that is not able to '
             'capture PSA tests performed outside the VA health system. '
             'Therefore, a proportion of the differences in PSA values '

             'true errors in data entry.Fourth, Leppert and Brooks leave out a '
             'key piece of our data when they claim that our finding of a '
             'U-shaped relationship between PSA and prostate cancer–specific '
             'mortality (PCSM) among Gleason 8–10 cancers may be due to a '
             'decimal point shift of the type they may have observed in VACCR. '
             'The key data they leave out is that for patients with Gleason ≤7 '
             'disease, we observed a linear relationship between PSA and PCSM, '
             'which is inconsistent with their hypothesis, because if a '
             'decimal point shift were the culprit then the U shape would be '
             'expected for all grades, and not just high grades. This '
             'epidemiological finding was corroborated by our genomic finding '
             'in a third independent institution-based data set that low-PSA, '
             'Gleason 8–10 tumors seemed to have more neuroendocrine features '

             'hepatocytes. Gene expression patterns in response to glucagon '
             'and FXR agonists were characterized by quantitative reverse '
             'transcription PCR and microarray analysis. FXR phosphorylation '
             'by protein kinase A was determined by mass spectrometry. The '
             'interaction of FOXA2 with FXR was identified by cistromic '
             'approaches and in vitro protein-protein interaction assays. The '
             'functional impact of the crosstalk between FXR, the PKA and '
             'FOXA2 signaling pathways was assessed by site-directed '

             'activation of gluconeogenic genes by glucagon, agonist-activated '
             'FXR and CREB. The second arm involves the inhibition of FXR’s '
             'ability to induce the anti-gluconeogenic nuclear receptor SHP by '
             'the glucagon-activated FOXA2 transcription factor, which '
             'physically interacts with FXR. Additionally, knockdown of Foxa2 '

             'expression of gluconeogenic genes, suggesting that the PKA and '
             'FOXA2 pathways regulate distinct subsets of FXR responsive '
             'genes.ConclusionsThus, hepatic glucose production is regulated '
             'during physiological fasting by FXR, which integrates the '
             'glucagon/cAMP signal and the FOXA2 signal, by being '

             'C57Bl6/J Fxr−/− mice when compared to Fxr+/+ mice (Fig. 1Fig. '
             '1A), suggesting a positive contribution of FXR to HGP. The '
             'ability of FXR to regulate glucose production by MPHs from '
             'Fxr+/+ or Fxr−/− mice was assayed after an 8\u202fh-treatment '
             'with the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064, with or without the '
             'protein kinase A (PKA) activator 8-CPT-cAMP (Fig. 1Fig. 1B), '
             'under experimental conditions defined as optimal for observing '
             'glucose production by isolated hepatocytes (Fig. S1B,CFig. '
             'S1B,C). GW4064 did not significantly affect GP, whereas '
             '8-CPT-cAMP and glucagon increased glucose production (Fig. '
             'S2AFig. S2A). Simultaneous activation of PKA and FXR with GW4064 '
             'or the natural FXR agonist CDCA potentiated glucose production '
             '(Fig. 1Fig. 1B, S2BS2B). While showing a lower basal glucose '
             'production, Fxr−/− MPHs were similarly sensitive to PKA '
             'stimulation as Fxr+/+ MPHs [fold change (FC) ∼2], but were '
             'insensitive to FXR agonism (Fig. 1Fig. 1B), like wild-type MPHs '
             'in which Fxr mRNA expression was knocked down (Fig. S3A,BFig. '
             'S3A,B). The expression of the gluconeogenic Foxo1 transcription '
             'factor did not vary between the two genotypes and was mildly '
             'induced by glucagon (Fig. S3C,DFig. S3C,D). Foxo1 knockdown, '
             'while affecting basal glucose production by MPHs, did not affect '
             'the potentiation of cAMP by the FXR agonist (Fig. S3E,FFig. '

{'abstract': 'BackgroundThe term pustular psoriasis indicates a group of '
             'severe skin disorders characterised by eruptions of '
             'neutrophil-filled pustules. The disease, which often manifests '
             'with concurrent psoriasis vulgaris (PV), can have an acute '
             'systemic (generalised pustular psoriasis, GPP) or chronic '
             'localised presentation (palmoplantar pustulosis, PPP; '
             'acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau, ACH). While mutations have '
             'been uncovered in IL36RN and AP1S3, the rarity of the disease '
             'has hindered the study of genotype-phenotype '
             'correlations.ObjectiveWe sought to characterise clinical and '
             'genetic features of pustular psoriasis through the analysis of '
             'an extended patient cohort.MethodsWe ascertained a dataset of '
             'unprecedented size, including 863 unrelated patients (251 GPP, '
             '560 PPP, 28 ACH, 24 multiple diagnoses). We undertook mutation '
             'screening in 473 cases.ResultsPV concurrence was lowest in PPP '
             '(15.8% vs. 54.4% in GPP and 46.2% in ACH, P<0.0005 for both), '
             'whereas mean age of onset was earliest in GPP (31.0 years vs. '
             '43.7 in PPP and 51.8 in ACH, P<0.0001 for both). The percentage '
             'of females was higher in PPP (77.0%) than GPP (62.5%) '
             '(P=5.8x10-5). The same applied to the prevalence of smokers '
             '(79.8% vs 28.3%, P<10-15). While AP1S3 alleles had similar '
             'frequency (0.03-0.05) across disease subtypes, IL36RN mutations '
             'were less common in PPP (0.03) than GPP (0.19) and ACH (0.16) '
             '(P=1.9x10-14 and 0.002, respectively). Importantly, IL36RN '
             'disease alleles had a dose-dependent effect on age of onset, in '
             'all forms of pustular psoriasis (P=0.003).ConclusionsThe '

             'posed in the present study, however, is whether a blood-based '
             'biomarker can be layered on top of prostate MRI to achieve even '
             'better results—fewer biopsies performed and fewer clinically '
             'significant cancers missed. Indeed, the authors found that '
             'compared to systematic biopsies in all men, performing '
             'MRI-targeted biopsy only in those with STHLM3 risk >10% detected '
             'a similar number of clinically significant cancers while '
             'decreasing the diagnosis of GG 1 cancers by 46% and avoiding 42% '
             'of prostate biopsies. The authors conclude that risk '
             'stratification with STHLM3 in combination with MRI-targeted '
             'biopsy can nearly halve the number of GG 1 tumors detected and '
             'prostate biopsies performed without decreasing the sensitivity '
             'to detect GG 2 and higher cancer.However, this conclusion is in '
             'comparison to a systematic biopsy only strategy and does not '
             'fully capture the potential tradeoffs being made. In the absence '
             'of complete pathology for all men, a true “denominator” of '
             'disease prevalence is not known; however, the number of men '
             'diagnosed by the combination of targeted and systematic biopsies '
             'likely gives a very close approximation of this. When '
             'considering cancers diagnosed by the combination of targeted and '
             'systematic biopsies, performing MRI-targeted biopsy alone in '
             'those with a STHLM3 risk >10% led to missing 19% of clinically '
             'significant cancers. Performing targeted and systematic biopsies '
             'in men with STHLM3 risk >10% still missed 8% of clinically '
             'significant cancers. These numbers highlight the potential costs '
             'associated with adding STHLM3 to MRI as a tool to selectively '
             'forego prostate biopsy.In the absence of perfect predictive '
             'tools, the decreased diagnosis of clinically insignificant '
             'cancers and the missed clinically significant cancers are really '
             'two sides of the same coin. But how do we weigh the benefits of '
             'biopsies avoided and low-risk cancers undiagnosed with the costs '
             'of missed high-grade cancers? Certainly, the consequences of '
             'these are not equivalent. Missing a clinically significant '
             'cancer can have substantial repercussions for the patient. '
             'However, the diagnosis of a GG 1 cancer is becoming less and '
             'less harmful to men due to widespread adoption of active '
             'surveillance.In addition to the potential for missing '

{'abstract': 'SummaryMany animals rely on vision to detect, locate, and track '

{'abstract': 'It has become clear that early life (including in utero '
             'exposures), is a key window of vulnerability where environmental '
             'exposures can alter developmental trajectories and initiate '
             'allergic disease development. However, recent evidence suggests '
             'that there may be additional windows of vulnerability to '
             'environmental exposures in the parental generation before '
             'conception, or even in previous generations. There is evidence '
             'suggesting that information of prior exposures can be '
             'transferred across generations, and experimental animal models '
             'suggest that such transmission may be conveyed through '
             'epigenetic mechanisms. While the molecular mechanisms of inter- '
             'and trans-generation epigenetic transmission have yet to be '
             'determined, the realisation that environment before conception '

             '2018.Background: Atrial fibrillation typically presents with '
             'tachycardia; atrial fibrillation with bradycardia is much less '
             'common. Bradycardia may be due to increased vagal tone, drugs '
             'affecting the atrioventricular node, or conduction system '
             'disease. Symptomatic bradycardia caused by conduction system '
             'disease is often treated with a pacemaker, because medications '
             'are not usually effective. Atropine, glycopyrrolate, '
             'hyoscyamine, and other anticholinergic drugs inhibit receptors '
             'that are present in smooth and cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial '
             'and atrioventricular node, and the exocrine glands (1–3). These '
             'drugs are often used to inhibit gastrointestinal propulsion and '
             'decrease urinary bladder contractions and secretions of the '

             'etiological factor in some of the patients with cryptogenic '
             'cirrhosis’. Two decades ago, hepatologists were reluctant to '
             'diagnose NASH cirrhosis without firm histological evidence. The '
             'knowledge base regarding the natural history of NASH has '
             'increased since then, and most hepatologists are very '
             'comfortable making a clinical diagnosis of NASH cirrhosis '
             'without needing confirmatory liver histology or firm '
             'longitudinal evidence of progression from NASH through various '
             'stages of fibrosis to cirrhosis. It is very well recognized that '
             'steatosis may disappear when NASH progresses to cirrhosis, and '
             'that histological confirmation of NASH cirrhosis may not be '
             'possible in many with a clinical diagnosis of NASH cirrhosis. '
             'The same rules also apply for other conditions such as '
             'autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and alcoholic liver disease where '
             'evidence of etiological factors may not be obvious once the '
             'disease has progressed to advanced cirrhosis.Another suggestion '
             'of our critics is that the body composition (loss of muscle '
             'mass, weight loss) may change with advanced cirrhosis and '
             'additionally, fluid overload may spuriously inflate the BMI. '
             'Therefore, obesity assessment may not be accurate in patients '
             'with cirrhosis. This argument also has no validity in this '
             'comparative analysis as fluid overload, loss of muscle mass or '
             'weight loss will be applicable to all patients in our study (as '
             'they were all listed for liver transplantation) irrespective of '
             'their etiology.In our study, we compared an unselected (thereby '
             'avoiding a selection bias and the subjectivity of small, single '
             'center studies) cohort of patients who were listed by the '
             'transplant centers throughout the country. Our retrospective '
             'comparative analysis contained a large cohort (where data entry '
             'was prospective) that included 7,999 patients with cryptogenic '
             'cirrhosis, 11,302 with NASH, 21,714 with alcoholic cirrhosis and '
             '3,447 with AIH. It is true that the UNOS database was not '
             'created with the intention of addressing the proposed question, '
             'but it was a very large dataset with adequate granularity to '
             'analyze the included variables, fulfilling the basic principles '
             'of data mining. In our analysis, type 2 DM was present in 53% of '
             'patients with NASH, but the prevalence was only 29% in '
             'cryptogenic cirrhosis, 16% in alcoholic cirrhosis, 16% with AIH. '
             'Similarly, obesity was more common in patients with NASH '
             'cirrhosis (65.2%) compared to those with cryptogenic cirrhosis '
             '(42%), alcoholic cirrhosis (32.7%) and AIH (37.1%). When NASH '
             'and cryptogenic cirrhosis were matched for age, gender and year '
             'of listing, DM (50.7% vs. 30.2%) and obesity (65.5% vs. 42.3%) '
             'were more prevalent in NASH compared to cryptogenic cirrhosis. '
             'The differences remained similar even when patients were '
             'stratified by obesity (BMI 30 or less and above 30) suggesting '
             'that obese cryptogenic cirrhosis also cannot be equated to NASH '
             'cirrhosis.When we analyzed the data of transplanted patients '
             'with similar model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores '
             '(mean 23.7 vs. 23.9), after excluding those with hepatocellular '
             'carcinoma, type 2 DM (44.9% vs. 24.5%) and obesity (62.5% vs. '
             '40.7%) were more common in NASH compared to cryptogenic '
             'cirrhosis. This clearly refutes the argument that our '
             'observations were either a reflection of a higher prevalence of '
             'HCC in the NASH group or the inclusion of cryptogenic cirrhosis '

{'abstract': 'Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established '
             'treatment choice for Parkinson’s disease (PD), essential tremor '
             'and movement disorders, its effectiveness for the management of '
             'treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unclear. Herein, we '
             'conducted an integrative review on major neuroanatomical targets '
             'of DBS pursued for the treatment of intractable TRD. The aim of '
             'this review article is to provide a critical discussion of '
             'possible underlying mechanisms for DBS-generated antidepressant '
             'effects identified in preclinical studies and clinical trials, '
             'and to determine which brain target(s) elicited the most '
             'promising outcomes considering acute and maintenance treatment '
             'of TRD. Major electronic databases were searched to identify '
             'preclinical and clinical studies that have investigated the '
             'effects of DBS on depression-related outcomes. Overall, 92 '
             'references met inclusion criteria, and have evaluated six unique '
             'DBS targets namely the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG), '
             'nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral capsule/ventral striatum or '
             'anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC), medial forebrain '
             'bundle (MFB), lateral habenula (LHb) and inferior thalamic '
             'peduncle for the treatment of unrelenting TRD. Electrical '
             'stimulation of these pertinent brain regions displayed '
             'differential effects on mood transition in patients with TRD. In '
             'addition, 47 unique references provided preclinical evidence for '
             'putative neurobiological mechanisms underlying antidepressant '
             'effects of DBS applied to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, '
             'NAc, MFB, LHb and subthalamic nucleus. Preclinical studies '
             'suggest that stimulation parameters and neuroanatomical '
             'locations could influence DBS-related antidepressant effects, '
             'and also pointed that modulatory effects on monoamine '
             'neurotransmitters in target regions or interconnected brain '
             'networks following DBS could have a role in the antidepressant '
             'effects of DBS. Among several neuromodulatory targets that have '
             'been investigated, DBS in the neuroanatomical framework of the '
             'SCG, ALIC and MFB yielded more consistent antidepressant '
             'response rates in samples with TRD. Nevertheless, more '
             'well-designed randomized double-blind, controlled trials are '
             'warranted to further assess the efficacy, safety and '
             'tolerability of these more promising DBS targets for the '
             'management of TRD as therapeutic effects have been inconsistent '
