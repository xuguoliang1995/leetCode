At the same time, empirical research on the insight-outcome relationship is rare, and its generalizability is restricted by the use of a wide range of definitions and methods among studies. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to systematically examine the association between patient insight and psychotherapy outcome across a range of treatment modalities.Insight was defined as patients’ understanding of associations between past and present experiences, typical relationship patterns, and the relation between interpersonal challenges, emotional experience, and psychological symptoms. From 13,849 initially identified abstracts, the authors extracted 23 independent effect sizes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to assess the magnitude of the insight-outcome relationship. Risk of publication bias was assessed with funnel plot inspections, Egger’s regression test, and Duval and Tweedie’s trim-and-fill procedure as sensitivity analyses.A significant, moderate correlation (r=0.31) was observed between insight and treatment outcome. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results.The findings support the importance of insight for psychotherapy outcome. Insight may be a relevant mechanism of change across different treatment modalities.", "doi": "10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17080847", "authors": ["Simone  Jennissen", "Julia  Huber", "Johannes C.

This single dimension of general psychopathology has been termed “p,” because it conceptually parallels a dimension already familiar to behavioral scientists and clinicians: the “g” factor of general intelligence. As the g dimension reflects low to high mental ability, the p dimension represents low to high psychopathology severity, with thought disorder at the extreme. The dimension of p unites all disorders. It influences present/absent status on hundreds of psychiatric symptoms, which modern nosological systems typically aggregate into dozens of distinct diagnoses, which in turn aggregate into three overarching domains, namely, the externalizing, internalizing, and psychotic experience domains, which finally aggregate into one dimension of psychopathology from low to high: p. Studies show that the higher a person scores on p, the worse that person fares on measures of family history of psychiatric illness, brain function, childhood developmental history, and adult life impairment. A dimension of p may help account for ubiquitous nonspecificity in psychiatry: multiple disorders share the same risk factors and biomarkers and often respond to the same therapies. Here, the authors summarize the history of the unidimensional idea, review modern research into p, demystify statistical models, articulate some implications of p for prevention and clinical practice, and outline a transdiagnostic research agenda.", "doi": "10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17121383", "authors": ["Avshalom  Caspi", "Terrie E.

The authors sought to investigate how structural maturation of these regions in childhood varies with level of anhedonia and predicts later substance use.The study employed data from a sample of depressed and healthy preschoolers studied longitudinally that included three waves of neuroimaging from school age to adolescence. Three years after scan 3, at ages 13–18, participants underwent a comprehensive behavioral and substance use assessment. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate the relationship between anhedonia and the growth trajectories of the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. Zero-inflated Poisson regression models were then used to determine whether the intercepts and slopes of these trajectories predicted later alcohol and marijuana use frequency in adolescence.The anhedonia-by-age interaction was significant in the multilevel modeling of orbitofrontal cortical but not striatal volume. Higher anhedonia ratings were significantly associated with steeper decline in orbitofrontal cortical volume with age. Orbitofrontal cortical volume and thickness at age 12 and trajectory over time significantly and negatively predicted subsequent alcohol and marijuana use frequency but not depression during adolescence.The findings suggest that the development of the orbitofrontal cortex during childhood is strongly linked to experiences of anhedonia and that these growth trajectories predict substance use during a developmentally critical period.", "doi": "10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17070777", "authors": ["Joan L.

These limitations have spawned several combinatorial pharmacogenetic testing products that are marketed to physicians. Typically, combinatorial pharmacogenetic decision support tools use algorithms to integrate multiple genetic variants and assemble the results into an easily interpretable report to guide prescribing of antidepressants and other psychotropic medications. The authors review the evidence base for several combinatorial pharmacogenetic decision support tools whose potential utility has been evaluated in clinical settings.

The authors compared individually delivered mantram repetition therapy and another non-trauma-focused treatment for PTSD.The study was a two-site, open-allocation, blinded-assessment randomized trial involving 173 veterans diagnosed with military-related PTSD from two Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics (January 2012 to March 2014). The mantram group (N=89) learned skills for silent mantram repetition, slowing thoughts, and one-pointed attention. The comparison group (N=84) received present-centered therapy, focusing on currently stressful events and problem-solving skills. Both treatments were delivered individually in eight weekly 1-hour sessions. The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and by self-report. Secondary outcome measures included insomnia, depression, anger, spiritual well-being, mindfulness, and quality of life. Intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using linear mixed models.The mantram group had significantly greater improvements in CAPS score than the present-centered therapy group, both at the posttreatment assessment (between-group difference across time, −9.98, 95% CI=−3.63, −16.00; d=0.49) and at the 2-month follow-up (between-group difference, −9.34, 95% CI=−1.50, −17.18; d=0.46). Self-reported PTSD symptom severity was also lower in the mantram group compared with the present-centered therapy group at the posttreatment assessment, but there was no difference at the 2-month follow-up. Significantly more participants in the mantram group (59%) than in the present-centered therapy group (40%) who completed the 2-month follow-up no longer met criteria for PTSD (p<0.04). However, the percentage of participants in the mantram group (75%) compared with participants in the present-centered therapy group (61%) who experienced clinically meaningful changes (≥10-point improvements) in CAPS score did not differ significantly between groups.

Discovery of novel pharmacotherapies that engage therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of Alzheimer’s disease with psychosis would benefit from identifying the neurobiology of resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether alterations in the synaptic proteome were associated with resilience to psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease and, if present, were independent of neuropathologic burden.Quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to measure multiple neuropathologies in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from subjects with early and middle-stage Alzheimer’s disease who differed in psychosis status. Synaptic proteins were quantified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in gray matter homogenates from these subjects and from neuropathologically unaffected subjects. The synaptic proteome was similarly evaluated in cortical gray matter homogenate and in postsynaptic density fractions from an APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mouse model of amyloidosis with germline reduction in Kalrn, which has been shown to confer resilience to progression of psychosis-associated behaviors relative to APPswe/PSEN1dE9 alone.Subjects resilient to psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease had higher levels of synaptic proteins compared with those with psychosis and unaffected control subjects. Neuropathologic burden predicted less than 20% of the variance in psychosis status and did not account for the synaptic protein level differences between groups. Reduction of Kalrn in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice resulted in higher levels of synaptic proteins in cortical homogenate and normalized protein levels in the postsynaptic density.Accumulation of synaptic proteins, particularly those that are enriched in the postsynaptic density, is associated with resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease. One candidate mechanism for this synaptic proteome compensation is alteration in levels of proteins that facilitate the transport of synaptic proteins to and from the postsynaptic density.", "doi": "10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17080858", "authors": ["Josh M.

The authors sought to examine the multi-cross-sectional association between smoking behavior and performance in specific cognitive domains and the longitudinal association between change in smoking behavior and change in cognitive functioning in a large prospective study.The authors conducted a cohort study of patients with nonaffective psychosis (N=1,094), their siblings (N=1,047), and healthy control subjects (N=579). At baseline and at 3- and 6-year follow-ups, smoking behavior was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and cognitive functioning with a test battery. Multivariate linear mixed-effects regression analyses were conducted to assess associations between smoking and cognitive domains while adjusting for variation in demographic factors, psychopathology, medication, and substance use. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied.At baseline, 66.6% of the patients smoked, compared with 38.3% of the siblings and 25.2% of the control subjects. Significant multi-cross-sectional associations were found between smoking and lower processing speed in the patient and control groups compared with the nonsmoking patient group (estimate=−2.38, SE=0.84) and the nonsmoking control group (estimate=−3.13, SE=1.06). In siblings, smoking was significantly associated with lower performance in working memory and reasoning and problem solving compared with nonsmoking. Also, the number of cigarettes smoked per day was negatively associated with these domains. Patients, but not siblings and control subjects, who quit smoking showed a significant improvement in processing speed (estimate=4.90, SE=1.73).The study findings indicate that smoking is associated with poorer cognitive performance in patients, their siblings, and healthy control subjects compared with nonsmoking.

Fractional anisotropy measures of white matter tracts were extracted and compared. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the association between age and fractional anisotropy among the three groups.Fractional anisotropy significantly differed among the three groups in 14 of 20 white matter tracts defined in the Johns Hopkins University white matter template. Never-treated patients displayed greater reduction of fractional anisotropy than antipsychotic-treated patients in the left anterior thalamic radiation, the left cingulum-hippocampus pathway, the splenium and genu of the corpus callosum, and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, and greater fractional anisotropy in the right uncinate fasciculus. Both patient groups showed multiple reductions relative to healthy comparison subjects. Never-treated patients showed an accelerated and clinically relevant age-related reduction of fractional anisotropy in the genu of the corpus callosum.These psychoradiological findings provide insight into the regional distribution of white matter deficits in the years after illness onset in long-term schizophrenia.

However, no review has yet examined its role in depression by integrating conceptual and quantitative findings across functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG methodologies. The authors quantified these effects, with an emphasis on development.A total of 38 fMRI and 12 EEG studies were entered into fMRI and EEG meta-analyses. fMRI studies primarily examined reward anticipation and reward feedback. These were analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation method. EEG studies involved mainly the feedback-related negativity (FRN) event-related potential, and these studies were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis of the association between FRN and depression.Analysis of fMRI studies revealed significantly reduced striatal activation in depressed compared with healthy individuals during reward feedback. When region-of-interest analyses were included, reduced activation was also observed in reward anticipation, an effect that was stronger in individuals under age 18. FRN was also significantly reduced in depression, with pronounced effects in individuals under age 18. In longitudinal studies, reduced striatal activation in fMRI and blunted FRN in EEG were found to precede the onset of depression in adolescents.Taken together, the findings show consistent neural aberrations during reward processing in depression, namely, reduced striatal signal during feedback and blunted FRN. These aberrations may underlie the pathogenesis of depression and have important implications for development of new treatments.", "doi": "10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17101124", "authors": ["Hanna  Keren", "Georgia  O’Callaghan", "Pablo  Vidal-Ribas", "George A.

Homotypic continuity between early and later childhood depression has been observed, with alterations in brain function and structure similar to those reported in depressed adults. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and treating depression as early as developmentally possible, given the relative treatment resistance and small effect sizes for treatments later in life. The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial of a dyadic parent-child psychotherapy for early childhood depression that focuses on enhancing the child’s emotional competence and emotion regulation.A modified version of the empirically tested parent-child interaction therapy with a novel “emotion development” module (PCIT-ED) was compared with a waiting list condition in a randomized controlled trial in 229 parent-child dyads with children 3–6.11 years of age. Both study arms lasted 18 weeks.Children in the PCIT-ED group had lower rates of depression (primary outcome), lower depression severity, and lower impairment compared with those in the waiting list condition (Cohen’s d values, >1.0). Measures of child emotional functioning and parenting stress and depression were significantly improved in the PCIT-ED group.The findings from this randomized controlled trial of a parent-child psychotherapy for early childhood depression suggest that earlier identification and intervention in this chronic and relapsing disorder represents a key new pathway for more effective treatment.

Two meta-analyses were then conducted using data from patients having index depressive episodes with or without psychosis at study entry to determine the risk of any prior or subsequent psychotic episode and the risk of psychosis in all episodes.Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, and altogether they included 546 psychotic and 1,583 nonpsychotic patients with unipolar depression. In seven of the studies, the risk ratio for a prior or subsequent psychotic episode in patients whose index depressive episode was psychotic compared with those whose index episode was nonpsychotic was 9.98 (95% CI=4.75, 20.94). In eight studies, the risk ratio for psychosis among all episodes of depression in the subgroups with psychotic and nonpsychotic index episodes was 7.24 (95% CI=5.03, 10.43).

The clinical presentation inevitably overlaps with other respiratory disorders such as asthma and COPD. In addition, 4% to 72% of patients with severe COPD are found to have radiological bronchiectasis on CT scanning, with similar frequencies (20–30%) now being reported in cohorts with severe or uncontrolled asthma. Co-diagnosis of bronchiectasis with another airways disease has been reported to be associated with increased lung inflammation, frequent exacerbations, worse lung function and higher mortality. In addition, many patients with all three disorders suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis and upper airway disease resulting in a complex “mixed airway” phenotype.The management of asthma, bronchiectasis, COPD and upper airway diseases has been traditionally outlined in separate guidelines for each individual disorder. Recognition that the majority of patients have one or more overlapping pathologies requires a re-evaluation of how we treat airway disease. The concept of treatable traits promotes a holistic, pathophysiology based approach to treatment rather than a syndromic approach and may be more appropriate for patients with overlapping features.Here we review the current clinical definition, diagnosis, management and future directions for the overlap between bronchiectasis and other airway diseases.Footnotes This manuscript has recently been accepted for publication in the European Respiratory Journal .

Heritability was estimated in related (n=6,246) and unrelated (n=3,286) individuals.Results: Heritability of DLCO and DLCO/VA ranged between 23% and 28% in unrelated individuals and between 45% and 49% in related individuals. Meta-analysis identified a genetic variant in ADGRG6 that is significantly associated with DLCO/VA. Gene expression analysis of ADGRG6 in human lung tissue revealed a decreased expression in patients with COPD and subjects with decreased DLCO/VA.Conclusion: DLCO and DLCO/VA are heritable traits, with a considerable proportion of variance explained by genetics. A functional variant in ADGRG6 gene region was significantly associated with DLCO/VA. Pulmonary ADGRG6 expression was decreased in patients with COPD.Footnotes This manuscript has recently been accepted for publication in the European Respiratory Journal .

Breathlessness intensity (0–10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)) and physical function (Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Scale (AKPS)) were measured each visit. Time was anchored at death. Breathlessness trajectory was analysed by physical function and diagnosis using mixed effects regression.Results: Mean age was 71.5 (sd 15.1) years; 55.2% males; most with cancer. The last recorded AKPS was >40 for 26.8%. Breathlessness was worst in people with cardio-respiratory disease and AKPS >40, and breathlessness in the last week of life increased most in this group (adjusted mean 2.92 versus all others 1.51; p=0.0001). The only significant interaction was with diagnosis and function in the last week of life (p<0.0001).Conclusions: Breathlessness is more intense and increases more in people with better function and cardio-respiratory disease immediately before death. Whether there are reversible causes for these people should be explored prospectively. Omitting function from previous population estimates may have over-estimated breathlessness intensity for many patients in the days preceding death.Footnotes This manuscript has recently been accepted for publication in the European Respiratory Journal .

Pirfenidone has been approved for treatment of IPF, but little is known about the distinct metabolic changes that occur in the lung upon pirfenidone administration. Here, we performed a proof-of-concept study using high-resolution quantitative Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance-Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-FTICR-MSI) to simultaneously detect, visualise, and quantify in situ endogenous and exogenous metabolites in lungs of mice subjected to experimental fibrosis and human patients with IPF and to assess the effect of pirfenidone treatment on metabolite levels. Metabolic pathway analysis and endogenous metabolite quantification revealed that pirfenidone treatment restores redox imbalance and glycolysis in IPF tissues, and down-regulates ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, thereby likely contributing to in situ modulation of collagen processing. As such, we detected specific alterations in metabolite pathways in fibrosis, and importantly, metabolic recalibration following pirfenidone treatment. Together, these results highlight the suitability of high-resolution MALDI-FTICR-MSI for deciphering the therapeutic effects of pirfenidone and provide a preliminary analysis of the metabolic changes that occur during pirfenidone treatment in vivo . These data may therefore contribute to improvement of currently available therapies for IPF.Footnotes This manuscript has recently been accepted for publication in the European Respiratory Journal .

This study aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA regulatory networks underlying CMH.miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in bronchial biopsies from 63 COPD patients were associated with CMH using linear regression. Potential mRNA targets of each CMH-associated miRNA were identified using Pearson correlations. GSEA and STRING analyses were used to identify key genes and pathways.Twenty miRNAs and 539 mRNAs were differentially expressed with CMH in COPD. The expression of 10 miRNAs was significantly correlated with the expression of one or more mRNAs. Of these, miR-134-5p, miR146a-5p and the let-7 family had the highest representation of CMH-associated mRNAs among their negatively correlated predicted targets. KRAS and EDN1 were identified as key regulators of CMH and were negatively correlated predicted targets of miR-134-5p and the let-7a/d/f-5p, respectively. GSEA suggested involvement of MUC5AC- related genes and several other relevant gene sets in CMH. The lower expression of miR-134-5p was confirmed in primary airway fibroblasts from COPD patients with CMH.We identified miR-134-5p, miR-146a-5p and let-7 family, along with their potential target genes including KRAS and EDN1, as potential key miRNA-mRNA networks regulating CMH in COPD.Footnotes This manuscript has recently been accepted for publication in the European Respiratory Journal .

DSAs are currently detected by Luminex technique, which may be overly sensitive. The new C1q assay allows for the exclusive detection of complement (C1q)-binding antibodies, involved in antibody-mediated rejection.Objectives: To investigate whether early detection of complement-binding DSAs is associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and survival.Methods: From 2009–2012, LTx recipients from 3 transplantation centers were screened for the presence of DSA and their complement-binding capacity during the 6–12months post-transplantation in stable condition.Results: The analysis included 168 patients. The 3-year rates of freedom from CLAD and graft survival were lower for patients with complement-binding DSAs (33.6% and 53.7%, respectively), as compared with patients with non–complement-binding DSAs (61.9% and 77.4%, respectively) and patients without DSA (70% and 84.9%, respectively) (p<0.001 and p=0.001,respectively). Detection of complement-binding DSA was associated with a risk of graft loss that was nearly tripled after adjustement for clinical, functional, histologic, and immunologic factors (hazard ratio, 2.98; 95% CI,1.33 to 6.66;p=0.008).Conclusion: Assessment of the C1q-binding capacity of DSA appears to be useful in identifying stable lung transplant recipients at high risk for lung-allograft loss.Footnotes This manuscript has recently been accepted for publication in the European Respiratory Journal .

In patients with predicted severeAP and necrotizing pancreatitis, the AGA suggests against the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence.The technical review,1x1Vege, S., DiMagno, M., Forsmark, C.E. et al. Initial medical treatment of acute pancreatitis: AGA Institute Technical Review. Gastroenterology. 2018;Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (2) | Google ScholarSee all References which included 10 RCTs addressing the role of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with predicted severe AP and necrotizing pancreatitis, demonstrated a reduction in the risk of infected pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36−0.86) and a trend toward reduction in mortality (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.42−1.04). However, in a subgroup analysis that included only recent trials published after 2002, no differences in risks of infected pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.44−1.49) or mortality (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.52−1.8) were noted. Similarly, there were no differences in these 2 critical outcomes among higher-quality studies. Given the higher methodologic quality of the recent studies, the guideline panel placed greater emphasis on results published after 2002 for this recommendation. Prophylactic antibiotics had no impact on the rates of important outcomes, such as persistent single organ failure, multiple organ failure or multiple organ dysfunction of unclear duration, single organ failure of unclear duration, and hospital length of stay. Though this recommendation statement is specific for patients with severe AP, it should be clarified that there is also no role for prophylactic antibiotics in patients with milder forms of AP. The overall quality of evidence was graded as low because of methodologic limitations (ie, risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants and study personnel and imprecision).Recommendation 3. In patients with acute biliary pancreatitis and no cholangitis, the AGA suggests against the routine use of urgent ERCP. Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence.A total of 8 RCTs addressed the role of urgent ERCP in the management of patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis.1x1Vege, S., DiMagno, M., Forsmark, C.E. et al. Initial medical treatment of acute pancreatitis: AGA Institute Technical Review. Gastroenterology. 2018;Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (2) | Google ScholarSee all References Compared to conservative management, urgent ERCP had no impact on critical outcomes, such as mortality and multiple organ failure, and on important outcomes, such as single organ failure (eg, respiratory or renal), infected pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis, and total rates of necrotizing pancreatitis. Similar findings were noted in a subgroup analysis of studies that clearly excluded patients with biliary obstruction. The guideline panel acknowledged the results of a single study demonstrating a reduction in hospital length of stay, but the overall body of evidence for this end point is sparse. The overall quality of evidence was graded as low given the inconsistency of results, indirectness of the evidence, and imprecision of results. The panel also acknowledged the limitations of published studies inexcluding patients with acute cholangitis (a clear indication for ERCP in patients with or without acute biliary pancreatitis).Recommendation 4. In patients with AP, the AGA recommends early (within 24 hours) oral feeding as tolerated rather than keeping the patient nil per os. Strong recommendation; moderate quality evidence.Traditional dogma regarding management of AP prescribed “bowel rest” in an attempt to avoid further stimulation of the inflamed pancreas. However, current evidence demonstrates the benefit of the opposite approach, that is, early feeding. Maintaining enteral nutrition is thought to help protect the gut−mucosal barrier and reduce bacterial translocation, thereby reducing the risk of infected peripancreatic necrosis and other serious AP outcomes.20x20Windsor, A.C., Kanwar, S., Li, A.G. et al. Compared with parenteral nutrition, enteral feeding attenuates the acute phase response and improves disease severity in acute pancreatitis. Gut. 1998;42: 431–435Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (545) | Google ScholarSee all ReferencesCombined results of 11 RCTs that addressed the role of early vs delayed feeding demonstrated no difference in mortality for early vs delayed feeding. There was, however, a 2.5-fold higher risk of interventions for necrosis associated with delayed vs early feeding (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.41−4.35), as well as trends observed for higher rates of infected peripancreatic necrosis (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 0.80−3.60), multiple organ failure (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.49−8.22), and total necrotizing pancreatitis (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 0.88−3.86) associated with delayed feeding. Based on these studies, the AGA recommends initiation of early oral feeding (generally within 24 hours) instead of keeping patients NPO. While type of diet was not specifically examined in the technical review, success of early feeding has been demonstrated using a variety of diets including low-fat, normal fat, and soft or solid consistency,21x21Lankisch, P.G., Apte, M.,and Banks, P.A. Acute pancreatitis. Lancet. 2015;386: 85–96Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (155) | Google ScholarSee all References and thus starting with a clear liquid diet is not required. The panel recognized that early feeding is not successful in all AP patients due to pain, vomiting, or ileus, and feeding may need to be delayed beyond 24 hours in some cases. Furthermore, some patients who are intolerant of oral feeding may require placement of an enteral tube for nutritional support (see Recommendations 5 and 6). However, routine or empiric orders for nil per os status in patients with AP should generally be avoided in favor of feeding trials. This is a strong recommendation based on the moderate quality evidence underpinning the statement.Recommendation 5. In patients with AP and inability to feed orally, the AGA recommends enteral rather than parenteral nutrition. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.The technical review identified 12 RCTs that compared the use of parenteral (ie, total parenteral nutrition) vs enteral (oral or enteral tube) feeding in patients with AP. There was clear evidence to support the benefit of enteral nutrition over total parenteral nutrition with respect to reduced risk of infected peripancreatic necrosis (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.15−0.51), single organ failure (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10−0.62), and multiple organ failure (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27−0.63). The AGA issued a strong recommendation based on the overall moderate quality of available evidence, and the likelihood of increased harm associated with the unnecessary use of parenteral nutrition.Recommendation 6. In patients with predicted severe or necrotizing pancreatitis requiring enteral tube feeding, the AGA suggests either nasogastric or nasoenteral route. Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence.Three RCTs were identified in the technical review that specifically addressed the issue of nasogastric vs nasoenteral (either nasoduodenal or nasojejunal) feeding in AP.1x1Vege, S., DiMagno, M., Forsmark, C.E. et al.

Gastroenterology. 2018;Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (2) | Google ScholarSee all References The trials did not demonstrate a mortality benefit associated with either modality (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.44−2.30), but there were several methodologic issues that made the evidence of low quality, including a small number of RCTs, high risk of performance bias due to participant blinding, and a high risk of detection bias due to issues with outcome assessment. The studies also did not adequately address the issue of safety, including aspiration risk, with either of these modalities. The panel recognizes that safety concerns regarding the risk of aspiration may preclude practitioners from using nasogastric tubes in patients with severe AP.Recommendation 7. In patients with acute biliary pancreatitis, the AGA recommends cholecystectomy during the initial admission rather than after discharge. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.Cholecystectomy can clearly prevent recurrent episodes of AP after an index case of biliary or gallstone pancreatitis.22x22Yadav, D., O'Connell, M.,and Papachristou, G.I. Natural history following the first attack of acute pancreatitis. Am J Gastroenterol. 2012;107: 1096–1103Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (100) | Google ScholarSee all References However, the appropriate timing of cholecystectomy in patients with biliary or gallstone pancreatitis has been the subject of vigorous debate. The primary argument in favor of earlier intervention is that patients with biliary pancreatitis who are discharged without a cholecystectomy have a significant risk of recurrent biliary events.23x23van Baal, M.C., Besselink, M.G., Bakker, O.J. et al. Timing of cholecystectomy after mild biliary pancreatitis: a systematic review. Ann Surg. 2012;255: 860–866Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (103) | Google ScholarSee all References However, those who advocate delayed cholecystectomy argue that performing surgery at a later time point when the acute inflammatory state of AP has subsided may be safer and associated with better surgical outcomes.Moderate quality evidence from a single randomized controlled clinical trial24x24da Costa, D.W., Bouwense, S.A., Schepers, N.J. et al.

Lancet. 2015;386: 1261–1268Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (62) | Google ScholarSee all References found that cholecystectomy performed during the initial admission for patients with suspected biliary pancreatitis was associated with substantial reductions in a composite outcome of mortality and gallstone-related complications (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09−0.61), readmission for recurrent pancreatitis (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07−0.90), and pancreaticobiliary complications (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09−0.61). Same-admission cholecystectomy did not differ from delayed cholecystectomy with respect to rates of conversion from laparoscopy to open approach or surgical difficulty. The AGA issued a strong recommendation due to the quality of available evidence and the high likelihood of benefit from early vs delayed cholecystectomy in this patient population.Recommendation 8. In patients with acute alcoholic pancreatitis, the AGA recommends brief alcoholintervention during admission. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.The technical review identified significant knowledge gaps in this field with a paucity of RCTs addressing the role of alcohol counseling.1x1Vege, S., DiMagno, M., Forsmark, C.E. et al. Initial medical treatment of acute pancreatitis: AGA Institute Technical Review. Gastroenterology. 2018;Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (2) | Google ScholarSee all References The panel’s decision to provide a strong recommendation for a brief alcohol counseling intervention during admission was driven by the following published studies. A single RCT addressed the role of alcohol counseling on recurrent attacks of AP in patients with a first attack of AP with a clear history of alcohol use and exclusion of other possible etiologies.25x25Nordback, I., Pelli, H., Lappalainen-Lehto, R. et al. The recurrence of acute alcohol-associated pancreatitis can be reduced: a randomized controlled trial. Gastroenterology. 2009;136: 848–855Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (89) | Google ScholarSee all References Patients were randomized to either repeated intervention at 6-month intervals for 2 years at an outpatient gastrointestinal clinic or single intervention at initial hospitalization. There was a strong trend toward a reduction for total hospital admission rates with no statistically significant differences for outcomes, such as second attack of pancreatitis, definite recurrent pancreatitis, or ≥2 recurrent attacks of pancreatitis. The second source of evidence that supports this recommendation was a Cochrane review of alcohol reduction strategies in primary care populations (21 RCTs, n= 7286), although not specifically addressing patients with AP.26x26Kaner, E.F., Beyer, F., Dickinson, H.O. et al.

Extended intervention compared to brief intervention was associated with a nonsignificantly greater reduction in alcohol consumption. Finally, A follow-up meta-analysis addressing the effectiveness of brief interventions in primary care and differences between efficacy and effectiveness trials demonstrated similar results in reduction in alcohol consumption in participants receiving a brief intervention and no significant difference in effect sizes for efficacy and effectiveness trials.27x27Kaner, E.F., Dickinson, H.O., Beyer, F. et al.

Accessed July 31,2017.Google ScholarSee all References, 13x13Institute of Medicine. Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust. The National Academies Press,Washington, DC; 2011Google ScholarSee all References These guidelines are intended to reduce practice variation and promote high-quality and high-value care for patients with AP. Current evidence supports the benefit of goal-directed fluid resuscitation, early oral feeding, and enteral rather than parenteral nutrition, in all patients with AP. Our evidence profiles also support the benefit of same-admission cholecystectomy for patients with biliary pancreatitis, and brief alcohol intervention for patients with alcohol-induced pancreatitis. In contrast, current evidence does not support a benefit for the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in predicted severe AP or routine ERCP in patients with AP without accompanying cholangitis.There are several knowledge gaps in the initial management of AP that have been identified for which RCTs are warranted, as is highlighted in the technical review that accompanies this guideline.1x1Vege, S., DiMagno, M., Forsmark, C.E. et al. Initial medical treatment of acute pancreatitis: AGA Institute Technical Review. Gastroenterology. 2018;Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (2) | Google ScholarSee all References More evidence is needed to deterimine the optimal fluid therapy practice in AP, and to better quantify the benefits and harms of goal-directed therapy vs other approaches. Current evidence does not support a clear benefit of Ringer’s lactate solution compared to normal saline for important outcomes, such as organ failure, necrosis, or mortality. Future RCTs addressing this topic would provide helpful guidance in this regard. Though risk stratification of patients with AP is important to ensure appropriate level of care, there is a dearth of high-quality evidence measuring the actual clinical impacts of using any particular severity prediction tool. High-quality multicenter RCTs are required to determine whether prophylactic antibiotics have a role in specific groups of patients with predicted severe AP and necrotizing pancreatitis. The appropriate timing of ERCP in patients with predicted severe biliary pancreatitis with persistent biliary obstruction also needs to be clarified in future studies. In addition, future research should focus on the impact of alcohol and tobacco cessation interventions on end points, such as recurrent AP, progression to chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, quality of life, health care utilization, and mortality.American Gastroenterological Association Institute Clinical Guidelines Committee: Seth Crockett, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC; Yngve Falck-Ytter, VA and Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH; Joseph Feuerstein, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brookline, MA; Steven Flamm, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL; Ziad Gellad, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC; Lauren Gerson, California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, CA; Samir Gupta, University of California, Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, San Diego, CA; Ikuo Hirano, Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, IL; John Inadomi, University of Washington, Seattle, WA; Geoffrey C.

Gastroenterology. 2018;154: 1298–1308.e7Google ScholarSee all References regarding the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) versus transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We raise serious methodologic and clinical concerns about the validity of this study that seems to be heavily biased in favor of LNF with little substantiating evidence to support the conclusions the authors make. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify these issues to inform readers of Gastroenterology and request that the authors amend their Discussion and Conclusions to acknowledge these deficiencies.We have several methodologic concerns. First, the authors conclude that LNF has the greatest ability to improve physiologic parameters of GERD compared with TIF or PPI. This conclusion is based on rankings and probabilities (ie, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA]). This conclusion is premature and ignores the basic principles of evaluating certainty in estimates of network meta-analysis. Since the early days of network meta-analysis, methodologists and statisticians have recognized that crude rankings can be misleading and ignore the domains of certainty in evidence. Instead of rankings, we should look at the pairwise relative association measures and apply the GRADE approach. Indeed, an empirical evaluation showed that the SUCRA estimates have extremely wide 95% credible intervals (median width of 65%) and that most of the time there is no significant difference between the best-ranked intervention and the second or third best-ranked interventions (shown in 90% and 71% of comparisons, respectively).2x2Brignardello-Petersen, R. et al.

Gastroenterology. 2018;154: 1298–1308.e7Google ScholarSee all References we observe this challenge. First of all, the SUCRA results show that LNF is superior compared with TIF in increasing lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. However, when looking at the odds ratio (0.65 [95% credible interval, 0.10–4.09]), we see that it ranges from a 90% reduction in the odds ratio up to a 400% increase in the opposite direction. Following GRADE (and intuitively), this evidence warrants very low certainty and according to the definition of certainty in evidence, and this means that future research will likely show different findings. The uncertainty regarding the pooled odds ratio extends to the study’s two other outcomes; persistent esophagitis and improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The only outcome that was associated with a statistically significant difference (percent of time pH < 4) was associated with a too extreme (and hard to believe) odds ratio of 0.08 and a prohibitively high degree of heterogeneity (I2= 88.3%), which is neither described or adjusted for by sensitivity analysis, nor acknowledged in the discussion.The authors also claim that TIF superiority trend in improving HRQOL is confounded by the short duration of follow-up, yet they failed to include the 3-year follow-up study results from the TIF TEMPO randomized trial accepted September 13, 2016, within the period of their search that extended to May 10, 2017. Finally, metaregression is not a tool to adjust or detect confounding when the included interventions vary in the length of follow-up; you cannot adjust for data you do not have.The heterogeneity in the study populations increases our concern about this analysis. The authors included studies evaluating different groups of patients with varying baseline characteristics, such as previous responsiveness to PPI therapy, esophagitis grade, and hiatal hernia. Furthermore, they included TIF studies with different iterations of the device and the procedure, which has significantly changed over time, as is the case with many promising innovations. Finally, the choice of primary outcomes was arbitrary and differed from the primary outcomes many of the included trials evaluated. Improvement in HRQOL, resolution of problematic reflux symptoms, and esophagitis are arguably the most important patient-centered outcomes. The authors focused instead on primary outcomes that readily place LNF at an advantage compared with the other 2 interventions; for example, PPIs, a major player in the author’s own design for this network meta-analysis, would not impact LES pressures at all. Thus, the reader is left puzzled why the authors selected the primary outcome of LES pressure increase in this context.The authors repeatedly surmised that LNF is the gold standard measure for GERD treatment and overstated its safety in the discussion. These statements are not congruent with findings and conclusions of the 2011 updated comparative effectiveness report of GERD management strategies by the Agency of Health Care Research and Quality, US Department of Health and Human Services.5x5Ip S, etal. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality;2011.Google ScholarSee all References Furthermore, invoking the MAUDE database to highlight the safety issues of TIF does not constitute equipoise in reporting treatment outcomes. No meaningful inferences can be derived from these data, considering the lack of a similar data repository for LNF.We are not arguing for the superiority of TIF over other management strategies. However, we do agree with the American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of GERD6x6American Gastroenterological Association. Available from: www.gastro.org/about/Technology_Coverage_Minimally_Invasive_GERD_Procedures.pdf.Google ScholarSee all References that recognizes the disease as a spectrum of care with a clear management gap for the millions of daily GERD patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by medical therapy, those who are concerned about the long-term sequalae of PPI use, and the patients opting out of surgical treatment. For appropriately selected patients, we also agree with the American Gastroenterological Association that the ≥3-year evidence for endoscopic fundoplication is sufficient to demonstrate sustainable improvement in health outcomes, symptom relief, decrease in PPI use, and improvement in esophageal pH. We can wholeheartedly recommend endoscopic therapy to appropriately selected GERD patients.Based on the methodologic and clinical shortcomings of the meta-analysis by Richter el al,1x1Richter, J. et al. Gastroenterology. 2018;154: 1298–1308.e7Google ScholarSee all References the conclusions are not substantiated by the study results. Knowing that the majority of physicians only read the abstract or the conclusion, this is quite problematic. A future noninferiority randomized, controlled trial comparing TIF with LNF in homogeneous patient population will be important.

However, expression of MAFG increases during cholestatic liver injury in mice and in cholangiocarcinomas. MAFG interacts directly with methionine adenosyltransferase α1 (MATα1) and other transcription factors at the E-box element to repress transcription. We studied mechanisms of MAFG up-regulation in cholestatic tissues and the pathways by which S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevent the increase in MAFG expression. We also investigated whether obeticholic acid (OCA), an farnesoid X receptor agonist, affects MAFG expression and how it contributes to tumor growth in mice.MethodsWe obtained 7 human cholangiocarcinoma specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues from patients that underwent surgical resection in California and 113 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues from China, along with clinical data from patients. Tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. MAT1A, MAT2A, c-MYC, and MAFG were overexpressed or knocked down with small interfering RNAs in MzChA-1, KMCH, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells; some cells were incubated with lithocholic acid (LCA, which causes the same changes in gene expression observed during chronic cholestatic liver injury in mice), SAMe, UDCA (100 μM), or farnesoid X receptor agonists. MAFG expression and promoter activity were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and transient transfection. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to study proteins that occupy promoter regions. We studied mice with bile-duct ligation, orthotopic cholangiocarcinomas, cholestasis-induced cholangiocarcinoma, diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors, and xenograft tumors.ResultsLCA activated expression of MAFG in HepG2 and MzChA-1 cells, which required the activator protein-1, nuclear factor–κB, and E-box sites in the MAFG promoter. LCA reduced expression of MAT1A but increased expression of MAT2A in cells. Overexpression of MAT2A increased activity of the MAFG promoter, whereas knockdown of MAT2A reduced it. MAT1A and MAT2A had opposite effects on the activator protein-1, nuclear factor–κB, and E-box–mediated promoter activity. Expression of MAFG and MAT2A increased, and expression of MAT1A decreased, in diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors in mice. SAMe and UDCA had shared and distinct mechanisms of preventing LCA-mediated increased expression of MAFG. OCA increased expression of MAFG, MAT2A, and c-MYC, but reduced expression of MAT1A. Incubation of human liver and biliary cancer cells lines with OCA promoted their proliferation; in nude mice given OCA, xenograft tumors were larger than in mice given vehicle. Levels of MAFG were increased in human HCC and cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. High levels of MAFG in HCC samples correlated with hepatitis B, vascular invasion, and shorter survival times of patients.ConclusionsExpression of MAFG increases in cells and tissues with cholestasis, as well as in human cholangiocarcinoma and HCC specimens; high expression levels correlate with tumor progression and reduced survival time. SAMe and UDCA reduce expression of MAFG in response to cholestasis, by shared and distinct mechanisms.

We analyzed the outcomes of these patients.MethodsWe performed a retrospective study of consecutive patients with a diagnosis of severe AH and no prior diagnosis of liver disease or episodes of AH, who underwent LT before 6 months of abstinence from 2006 through 2017 at 12 centers. We collected data on baseline characteristics, psychosocial profiles, level of alcohol consumption before LT, disease course and treatment, and outcomes of LT. The interval of alcohol abstinence was defined as the time between last drink and the date of LT. The primary outcomes were survival and alcohol use after LT, defined as slip or sustained.ResultsAmong 147 patients with AH who received liver transplants, the median duration of abstinence before LT was 55 days; 54% received corticosteroids for AH and the patients had a median Lille score of 0.82 and a median Sodium Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 39. Cumulative patient survival percentages after LT were 94% at 1 year (95% confidence interval [CI], 89%–97%) and 84% at 3 years (95% CI, 75%–90%). Following hospital discharge after LT, 72% were abstinent, 18% had slips, and 11% had sustained alcohol use. The cumulative incidence of any alcohol use was 25% at 1 year (95% CI, 18%–34%) and 34% at 3 years (95% CI, 25%–44%) after LT. The cumulative incidence of sustained alcohol use was 10% at 1 year (95% CI, 6%–18%) and 17% at 3 years (95% CI, 10%–27%) after LT. In multivariable analysis, only younger age was associated with alcohol following LT (P= .01). Sustained alcohol use after LT was associated with increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 4.59; P= .01).ConclusionsIn a retrospective analysis of 147 patients who underwent early LT (before 6 months of abstinence) for severe AH, we found that most patients survive for 1year (94%) and 3 years (84%), similar to patients receiving livertransplants for other indications. Sustained alcohol use after LT was infrequent but associated with increased mortality. Our findings support the selective use of LT as a treatment for severe AH. Prospective studies are needed to optimize selection criteria, management of patients after LT, and long-term outcomes.", "doi": "10.1053/j.gastro.2018.04.009", "authors": ["Brian P.

We assessed the risk of serious and opportunistic infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with thiopurine monotherapy, anti-TNF monotherapy, or combination therapy in a large cohort of patients in France.MethodsWe performed a nationwide population-based study of patients (18 years or older) with a diagnosis of IBD in the French national health insurance database; we collected data from January 1, 2009 until December 31, 2014. The risks of serious and opportunistic infections associated with exposure to combination therapy, anti-TNF, and thiopurine monotherapies were compared using marginal structural Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for baseline and time-varying sociodemographic characteristics, medications, and comorbidities.ResultsAmong the 190,694 patients with IBD included in our analysis, 8561 serious infections and 674 opportunistic infections occurred. Compared with anti-TNF monotherapy, combination therapy was associated with increased risks of serious infection (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05–1.45) and opportunistic infection (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.32–2.91). Compared with thiopurine monotherapy, anti-TNF monotherapy was associated with increased risks of serious infection (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.56–1.88), mycobacterial infection (HR,1.98; 95% CI, 1.15–3.40), and bacterial infection (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.23–4.58, respectively). Conversely, anti-TNF monotherapy was associated with decreased risk of opportunistic viral infection compared with thiopurine monotherapy (HR,0.57; 95% CI, 0.38–0.87).ConclusionsIn a nationwide cohort study of patients with IBD in France, we found heterogeneity in risks of serious and opportunistic infections in patients treated with immune-suppressive regimens.

Lack of specific organ toxicity is considered to be a prerequisite for bowel preparations. Between cleansing efficacy and tolerability, however, the consequences of inadequate cleansing suggest that efficacy should be a higher priority than tolerability. Consequently, the choice of a bowel cleansing regimen should be based on cleansing efficacy first and patient tolerability second. However, efficacy and tolerability are closely interrelated. For example, a cleansing agent that is poorly tolerated and thus not fully ingested may not achieve an adequate cleansing.The goals of this consensus document are to provide expert, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians to optimize colonoscopy preparation quality and patient safety.

Quality indicators for colonoscopy. Am J Gastroenterol. 2006;101: 873–885Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (0) | Google ScholarSee all References In clinical trials cleansing quality often is estimated using scales that downgrade quality for retained fluid. In clinical practice, however, retained fluid and much of the semisolid debris in the colon can be removed by intraprocedural cleansing. Because the capacity to conduct effective mucosal inspection is established after intraprocedural cleansing, the preparation quality in clinical practice should be assessed only after appropriate intraprocedural washing and suctioning has been completed. For this reason, the use of a validated bowel preparation scale that includes scoring retained fluid (eg, Aronchick, Ottawa) is not recommended. The US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) considers the operational definition of an adequate preparation is one in which the colonoscopist can and does recommend a follow-up screening or surveillance interval for the next colonoscopy that is appropriate for the examination findings. Unfortunately, the scores in validated scales that correspond to the point at which the preparation meets the USMSTF operational definition of an adequate preparation (ability to follow the recommended screening or surveillance interval) generally are uncertain. In clinical practice clinicians often use an imprecisely defined 4-point scale of excellent, good, fair, and poor. In this scheme, excellent and good are widely viewed as adequate, but some research indicates that many fair preparations in clinical practice also are adequate.10x10Sherer, E.A., Imler, T.D.,and Imperiale, T.F.

Currently, the Boston Bowel Preparation scale comes closest to meeting these criteria because it does not consider retained fluid and a Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of 5 or higher was associated with only a 2% rate of recommending shortened follow-up intervals.61x61Hassan, C., Fuccio, L., Bruno, M. et al.

Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2012;10: 501–506Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (19) | Google ScholarSee all References A detailed review of bowel preparation scales is shown in Appendix BAppendix B.Whichever scale is used in practice, we recommend that the method for defining an adequate preparation should include whether the colonoscopist recommends the expected screening or surveillance intervals based on the colonoscopy findings, and that the ability to detect lesions greater than 5 mm in size throughout the colon is a clinically relevant test of adequacy and appropriateness to follow screening and surveillance intervals. Furthermore, endoscopists are encouraged to submit procedure reports into a data registry that benchmarks performance and quality measures against minimally accepted national thresholds and mean levels of performance among peers. If the rate of adequate bowel preparation for an endoscopist is below the USMSTF recommended benchmark of 85%, an improvement initiative should be undertaken. High rates of inadequate preparations can reflect low patient compliance, failure to adjust preparation regimens for medical predictors of inadequate preparation, or signal that processes and policies of the endoscopy unit need revision.Jump to SectionMethodsSearch StrategyEffect of Inadequate Preparation on Polyp/Adenoma Detection and Recommended Follow-up IntervalsDosing and Timing of Colon Cleansing RegimensSplit-Dose RegimensSame-Day RegimensObstacles to Split and Same-Day RegimensDiet During Bowel CleansingUsefulness of Patient Education and Navigators for Optimizing Preparation ResultsRating the Quality of Bowel Preparation During ColonoscopyFDA-Approved PreparationsPolyethylene Glycol–Electrolyte Lavage SolutionOral Sulfate SolutionSodium PicosulfateSodium PhosphateOTC Non–FDA-Approved PreparationsPEG-3350 PowderMagnesium CitrateOther OTC ProductsAdjuncts to Colon Cleansing Before ColonoscopyDifferences in Patient Preference/Willingness to Repeat ComparisonsSelection of Bowel Preparation in Specific PopulationsAdvanced AgePediatricsInflammatory Bowel DiseaseAfter Bariatric SurgeryPregnancySalvage Options for Inadequate PreparationSummaryAppendix AKey Word Searches for USMSTF DocumentAppendix BBowel Preparation Quality ScalesAppendix CRisk Factors for Inadequate PreparationReferencesFDA-Approved PreparationsRecommendations1.Selection of a bowel-cleansing regimen should take into consideration the patient's medical history, medications, and, when available, the adequacy of bowel preparation reported from prior colonoscopies (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)2.A split-dose regimen of 4 L PEG-ELS provides high-quality bowel cleansing (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)3.In healthy nonconstipated individuals, a 4-L PEG-ELS formulation produces a bowel-cleansing quality that is not superior to a lower-volume PEG formulation (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)Polyethylene glycol–electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ELS)–based cleansing agents are available in 4 L (considered large or high volume) or as 2 L plus an adjunct (considered low volume).

The efficacy and safety of these products for specific indications may be unproven because the FDA's oversight of OTC products generally is conducted by therapeutic class rather than for individual drugs. Consequently, an OTC product may have little or no supporting evidence or comparative data showing either efficacy or safety relative to other available products. Products marketed specifically for colonoscopy bowel preparation must be evaluated in randomized trials to assess their efficacy and safety and then must receive approval via a New Drug Application (NDA) from the FDA. Such products are available only by prescription. For a purgative agent to be marketed without an approved NDA it must meet the requirements for OTC agents as set forth in the Laxative Monograph (Unpublished data). The FDA specifically recognized only 2 bowel cleansing kits,160x160Available: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/ucm093981.pdf. Accessed June 19, 2014.Google ScholarSee all References and any kit with different components would require an approved NDA and/or further amendment to the monograph (highly unlikely). These cleaning kits are as follows: magnesium citrate oral solution, bisacodyl tablets, and bisacodyl suppositories; and magnesium citrate oral solution, phenolphthalein, and sodium bicarbonate–sodium bitartrate suppositories.These OTC medications or combinations can be recommended by physicians as part of a bowel-cleansing regimen in preparing patients for surgery or for preparing the colon for x-ray or endoscopic examination.The following section reviews available data on several OTC agents that have been used for bowel cleansing before colonoscopy.Jump to SectionMethodsSearch StrategyEffect of Inadequate Preparation on Polyp/Adenoma Detection and Recommended Follow-up IntervalsDosing and Timing of Colon Cleansing RegimensSplit-Dose RegimensSame-Day RegimensObstacles to Split and Same-Day RegimensDiet During Bowel CleansingUsefulness of Patient Education and Navigators for Optimizing Preparation ResultsRating the Quality of Bowel Preparation During ColonoscopyFDA-Approved PreparationsPolyethylene Glycol–Electrolyte Lavage SolutionOral Sulfate SolutionSodium PicosulfateSodium PhosphateOTC Non–FDA-Approved PreparationsPEG-3350 PowderMagnesium CitrateOther OTC ProductsAdjuncts to Colon Cleansing Before ColonoscopyDifferences in Patient Preference/Willingness to Repeat ComparisonsSelection of Bowel Preparation in Specific PopulationsAdvanced AgePediatricsInflammatory Bowel DiseaseAfter Bariatric SurgeryPregnancySalvage Options for Inadequate PreparationSummaryAppendix AKey Word Searches for USMSTF DocumentAppendix BBowel Preparation Quality ScalesAppendix CRisk Factors for Inadequate PreparationReferencesPEG-3350 PowderPEG-3350 powder, an OTC laxative marketed for constipation, is available as an 8.3-oz bottle (238 g). When used for a precolonoscopy bowel preparation, the contents of 1 bottle often are mixed with 64 ounces of Gatorade (PepsiCo, Chicago, IL) to create a 2-L PEG formulation. In some instances, clinicians prescribe bisacodyl tablets or magnesium citrate in conjunction with the PEG-3350 powder.

These have included simethicone, flavored electrolyte solutions (eg, Gatorade), prokinetics, spasmolytics, bisacodyl, senna, olive oil, and probiotics. None consistently have shown improved efficacy, safety, or tolerability of the bowel preparation. Currently, the routine use of adjunctive agents for colonic cleansing before colonoscopy is not recommended, but the agents may be useful in select circumstances, at the discretion of the prescribing physician.Simethicone is the best-studied adjunctive agent for bowel cleansing. In a meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials comparing colonoscopy bowel purgative with or without the addition of simethicone, the overall efficacy of colon preparation was comparable (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 0.56–7.53; P=.27), despite a notable reduction in the presence of intraluminal bubbles (OR, 39.3; 95% CI, 11.4–135.9; P≤.01) in the group receiving simethicone.172x172Wu, L., Cao, Y., Liao, C. et al.

The following options can be considered in such cases:Recommendations1.Large-volume enemas can be attempted for patients who, presenting on the day of colonoscopy, report brown effluent despite compliance with the prescribed colon-cleansing regimen (Weak recommendation, very low quality evidence)2.Through-the-scope enema with completion colonoscopy on the same day can be considered, especially for those patients who receive propofol sedation (Weak recommendation, very low quality evidence)3.Waking the patient entirely from sedation and continuing with further oral ingestion of cathartic with same-day or next-day colonoscopy has been associated with better outcomes than delayed colonoscopy (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)Although multiple studies have addressed risk factors for inadequate preparation, only a single study examined such factors for a second examination. In 235 patients who underwent a second colonoscopy specifically because of inadequate preparation, the second examination failed again because of inadequate preparation in 54 of those 235 patients (23%).227x227Ben-Horin, S., Bar-Meir, S.,and Avidan, B.

Usefulness of an intensive bowel cleansing strategy for repeat colonoscopy after preparation failure. Dis Colon Rectum. 2011;54: 1578–1584Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (7) | Google ScholarSee all References reported on 51 adult patients (mean age, 61.5 y) with a previously failed outpatient colonoscopy as a result of inadequate preparation in whom they then tried an intensive bowel-cleansing strategy before the second procedure. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale was applied at the time of the initial colonoscopy and those with a score of 0 or 1 on any segment were deemed inadequate. The bowel regimen in these cases included a low-fiber diet for 72 hours followed by a liquid diet on the day before the procedure. On the evening of the procedure, 10 mg of bisacodyl was administered along with 1.5 L of PEG-ELS. A second 1.5-L dose of PEG-ELS was administered on the day of the colonoscopy. By using this approach, 90% (46 of 51) had an adequate preparation as assessed by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (ie, ≥2 each segment).Overall, the data on management of patients with inadequate preparation are limited. A variety of measures that use additional oral purgatives or enemas are likely to be effective. Supplemental measures aimed at effective colonoscopy and acted on as soon as deemed safe are likely to result in fewer patients being lost to follow-up evaluation. Patients who present to the endoscopy unit with persistent brown effluent are at increased risk of inadequate preparation and may warrant more oral laxatives or enemas before any attempt at colonoscopy.Jump to SectionMethodsSearch StrategyEffect of Inadequate Preparation on Polyp/Adenoma Detection and Recommended Follow-up IntervalsDosing and Timing of Colon Cleansing RegimensSplit-Dose RegimensSame-Day RegimensObstacles to Split and Same-Day RegimensDiet During Bowel CleansingUsefulness of Patient Education and Navigators for Optimizing Preparation ResultsRating the Quality of Bowel Preparation During ColonoscopyFDA-Approved PreparationsPolyethylene Glycol–Electrolyte Lavage SolutionOral Sulfate SolutionSodium PicosulfateSodium PhosphateOTC Non–FDA-Approved PreparationsPEG-3350 PowderMagnesium CitrateOther OTC ProductsAdjuncts to Colon Cleansing Before ColonoscopyDifferences in Patient Preference/Willingness to Repeat ComparisonsSelection of Bowel Preparation in Specific PopulationsAdvanced AgePediatricsInflammatory Bowel DiseaseAfter Bariatric SurgeryPregnancySalvage Options for Inadequate PreparationSummaryAppendix AKey Word Searches for USMSTF DocumentAppendix BBowel Preparation Quality ScalesAppendix CRisk Factors for Inadequate PreparationReferencesSummaryIneffective bowel cleansing for colonoscopy results in missed precancerous lesions and increased costs related to early repeat procedures. Efficacy and tolerability of bowel preparations are important and related goals, but efficacy is of primary importance because of the substantial consequences of inadequate cleansing. Adequate bowel preparation implies that the colonoscopist will recommend a screening or surveillance interval consistent with the findings of the examination and current screening and surveillance guidelines. The rate of adequate bowel cleansing should be at least 85%, and higher whenever possible. Awareness of medical factors that increase the risk of inadequate preparation and nonmedical factors that predict poor compliance with instructions can direct physicians to the use of more efficacious or aggressive preparation regimens or more extensive education (including navigation), respectively. Some patients who present with inadequate preparation can have their procedures salvaged by additional cleansing on the day of the procedure. Bowel preparation quality should be judged after intraprocedural efforts to enhance cleansing quality have been completed.The USMSTF members are representatives from the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

Each segment score is summed for a total Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score ranging from 0 to 9 (with 9 corresponding to a perfectly clean colon and 0 corresponding to a nonprepped colon). If the procedure is aborted because of an inadequate preparation, then the proximal segments are assigned a score of 0. A priori, the developers recommended that a score of less than 5 corresponds to an inadequate bowel preparation. The scale developers have published 4 endoscopic images depicting examples of preparations corresponding to scores of 0–3. Furthermore, a 15-minute training video was developed and is available on the Internet (https://www.cori.org/bbps/login.php). In the validation study, the weighted κ statistic for intra-observer agreement for the total Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score was 0.77, and the intraclass correlation coefficient for interobserver agreement was 0.74.235x235Lai, E.J., Calderwood, A.H., Doros, G. et al.

The polyp detection rate was 40%. For patients with a Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of 5 or greater the polyp detection rate was 40%, compared with 24% for those with a score of less than 5 (P< .02), and a repeat colonoscopy owing to inadequate preparation was recommended only 2% of the time, compared with 73% of the time for those with a score of less than 5 (P < .001).
